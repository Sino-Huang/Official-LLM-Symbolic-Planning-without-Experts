## Finetuned sentence encoder checkpoint
- Due to the size of the model, we are unable to provide the finetuned sentence encoder checkpoint. One can directly use the `finetuning_sentence_encoder` pipeline to finetune the sentence encoder on the training data.
- The finetuned sentence encoder checkpoint will be available after double-blind review process.
