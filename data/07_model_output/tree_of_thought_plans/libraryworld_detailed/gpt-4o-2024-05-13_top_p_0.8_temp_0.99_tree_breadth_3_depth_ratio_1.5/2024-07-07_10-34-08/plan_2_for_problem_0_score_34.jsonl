{"role": "user", "content": "Question: Here is the task.\nA natural language description of the domain\nDomain information: This domain is structured to allow organizing and managing books within a library setting. The actions and predicates support the movement of books between tables and shelves, ensuring that conditions like accessibility and the librarian's hands being free are met. Additionally, it includes managing book categories, shelf space, and check-out/return processes to reflect a more complex library system.\n\nA list of available predicates\n1. (on-shelf ?x ?y - book) ;; ?x is on top of ?y on the shelf\n2. (on-table ?x - book) ;; ?x is on the table\n3. (accessible ?x - book) ;; ?x is accessible (not covered)\n4. (hands-free) ;; The hands of the librarian are free\n5. (holding ?x - book) ;; The librarian is holding ?x\n6. (belongs-to-category ?x - book ?cat - category) ;; ?x belongs to the category ?cat\n7. (shelf-empty ?cat - category) ;; The shelf for category ?cat is empty\n8. (shelf-overflow ?cat - category) ;; The shelf for category ?cat is full\n9. (book-request ?book - book) ;; There is a request for book ?book\n10. (return-due ?book - book) ;; Book ?book is due for return\n11. (checked-out ?book - book) ;; Book ?book is checked out\n\nAction Description: \nAction Name: take-from-table\nAction Description: Imagine you're a librarian managing a table full of books. The 'take-from-table' action allows you to pick up a book that is on the table, provided it is accessible and your hands are free. This action simulates the scenario where you find a book on the table, ensure it's not covered by any other book, and then pick it up, thus holding it in your hands.\n\nAction Name: place-on-table\nAction Description: Picture a librarian holding a book. The 'place-on-table' action involves placing the held book onto the table. This action is feasible if the librarian is currently holding the book. Once placed, the book becomes accessible again, and the librarian's hands are free.\n\nAction Name: place-on-shelf\nAction Description: Consider a librarian holding a book and standing near a shelf. The 'place-on-shelf' action involves placing the held book on top of another book on the shelf, given that the book on the shelf is accessible. This action results in the held book becoming accessible, the book on the shelf becoming inaccessible, and the librarian's hands becoming free.\n\nAction Name: remove-from-shelf\nAction Description: Imagine a librarian approaching a shelf where one book is placed on top of another. The 'remove-from-shelf' action allows the librarian to take the top book off the shelf, provided it is accessible and the librarian's hands are free. This action makes the book on the shelf accessible and the librarian holds the removed book.\n\nAction Name: check-out\nAction Description: Envision a librarian assisting a patron who wishes to borrow a book. The 'check-out' action allows the librarian to mark a book as checked out, provided it is accessible and not already checked out. This action reflects the process of recording the book's status as borrowed and setting a return due date.\n\nAction Name: return-book\nAction Description: Imagine a patron returning a borrowed book to the library. The 'return-book' action enables the librarian to process the return, updating the book's status and removing any return due date. This action is applicable when the librarian is holding the book that needs to be returned.\n\n\n\nProblem Information: \n\nObject Snippet: (:objects\n    Book1 Book2 Book3 - book\n    Fiction Non_Fiction Reference - category\n)\n\n\nInitial State: In the library, there are three books: Book1, Book2, and Book3. Book3 is on top of Book1 and they are both on the shelf, while Book2 and Book1 are on the table. Both Book2 and Book3 are accessible, meaning they can be interacted with. The library worker's hands are free. Book1 belongs to the Fiction category, Book2 belongs to the NonFiction category, and Book3 belongs to the Reference category. All three categories (Fiction, NonFiction, and Reference) have empty shelves.\n\nGoal State: The goal is to have Book2 on top of Book3, and also Book1 on top of Book2.\n\nCurrent Action Plan:\nEmpty\n\nYour answer:\n"}
