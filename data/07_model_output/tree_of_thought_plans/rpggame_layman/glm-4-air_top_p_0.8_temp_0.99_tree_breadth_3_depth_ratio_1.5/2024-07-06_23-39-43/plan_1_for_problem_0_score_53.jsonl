The output can be parsed by a machine, so it is important to follow the structured format.\n# TONE #\nBe precise and concise in constructing the action plan sequence. Provide clear information about the objects involved, the numerical confidence score, and the boolean value for the goal state check.\n# AUDIENCE #\nYour audience is someone who is asking for a detailed action plan to solve sequential decision making problems. \n# RESPONSE #\nThe response should be in the following format:\n---\n**Response:**\n1.

{"role": "user", "content": "Question: Here is the task.\nA natural language description of the domain\nDomain information: Help the hero to get out of dungeon! A hero woke up in a dungeon full of monsters and traps (perhaps the party last night went wrong...) and needs your help to get out.  Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape\n\nA list of available predicates\n1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location\n2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location\n3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster\n4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap\n5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed\n6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells\n7. (arm-free) ;; Hero's hand is free\n8. (holding ?s - swords) ;; Hero's holding a sword\n9.

Make sure the hand is free.\n\nAction Name: pick-sword\nAction Description: Hero's picks a sword if he's in the same location\n\nAction Name: move-to-trap\nAction Description: Hero can move if the - hero is at current location - cells are connected, - when this action is executed, the hero gets into a location with a trap\n\nAction Name: destroy-sword\nAction Description: Hero's destroys his sword. So that he is arm-free and can disarm traps in the future if required. \n\nAction Name: move\nAction Description: Hero can move if the - hero is at current location - cells are connected, - there is no trap in current loc, and - destination does not have a trap/monster/has-been-destroyed Effects move the hero, and destroy the original cell. No need to destroy the sword.\n\n\n\nProblem Information: \n\nObject Snippet: (:objects\n    cell1 cell2 cell3 cell4 cell5 cell6 cell7 cell8 - cells\n    sword1 - swords\n)\n\n\nInitial State: In the dungeon, the hero starts at cell5, with free hands ready for action. The hero is aware of the dungeon's layout, which consists of multiple interconnected cells. A sword is located in cell4. The dungeon contains dangerous monsters located in cell3 and cell8, and a trap is present in cell2. The hero must navigate this treacherous environment, using the connections between the cells to move around. The connections are as follows:\n\n    Cell1 is connected to cell2.\n    Cell2 is connected to cell1 and cell3.\n    Cell3 is connected to cell2 and cell4.\n    Cell4 is connected to cell3 and cell5.\n    Cell5 is connected to cell4 and cell8.\n    Cell6 is connected to cell7.\n    Cell7 is connected to cell6 and cell8.\n    Cell8 is connected to cell7 and cell5.\n    Cell2 is also connected to cell6.\n    Cell3 is also connected to cell7.\n    Cell4 is also connected to cell8.\n\n\nGoal State: The hero's ultimate objective is to reach cell1 safely.\n\nCurrent Action Plan:\nEmpty\n\nYour answer:\n"}
