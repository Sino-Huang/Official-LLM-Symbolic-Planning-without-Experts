{"role": "user", "content": "Question: Here is the task.\nA natural language description of the domain\nDomain information: Help the hero to get out of dungeon! A hero woke up in a dungeon full of monsters and traps (perhaps the party last night went wrong...) and needs your help to get out.  Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape\n\nA list of available predicates\n1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location\n2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location\n3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster\n4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap\n5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed\n6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells\n7.

When this action is executed, the hero gets into a location with a monster\n\nAction Name: disarm-trap\nAction Description: **Disarm a trap** \u2013 if there is a trap in the room the hero is in and the hero is empty-handed (does not hold a sword), then the hero can disarm it\n\nAction Name: pick-sword\nAction Description: **Pickup** the sword if present in the room the hero is currently in and the hero is empty handed\n\nAction Name: move-to-trap\nAction Description: The hero can **move** to an adjacent room (connected by a corridor) that has not been destroyed (i.e., the hero has not already visited the room). When this action is executed, the hero gets into a location with a trap\n\nAction Name: destroy-sword\nAction Description: **Destroy** the sword that the hero currently holds. However, this can have unpleasant effects if done in a room with a trap or a monster: it triggers the trap or invites the monster to eat the hero.\n\nAction Name: move\nAction Description: The hero can **move** to an adjacent room (connected by a corridor) that has not been destroyed (i.e., the hero has not already visited the room).

The hero is aware of the dungeon's layout, which consists of multiple interconnected cells. A sword is located in cell4. The dungeon contains dangerous monsters located in cell3 and cell8, and a trap is present in cell2. The hero must navigate this treacherous environment, using the connections between the cells to move around. The connections are as follows:\n\n    Cell1 is connected to cell2.\n    Cell2 is connected to cell1 and cell3.\n    Cell3 is connected to cell2 and cell4.\n    Cell4 is connected to cell3 and cell5.\n    Cell5 is connected to cell4 and cell8.\n    Cell6 is connected to cell7.\n    Cell7 is connected to cell6 and cell8.\n    Cell8 is connected to cell7 and cell5.\n    Cell2 is also connected to cell6.\n    Cell3 is also connected to cell7.\n    Cell4 is also connected to cell8.\n\n\nGoal State: The hero's ultimate objective is to reach cell1 safely.\n\nCurrent Action Plan:\nEmpty\n\nYour answer:\n"}
