{"role": "system", "content": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a tool called Automated Planning Action Planner. \nYou are a technical expert in constructing and evaluating the quality of action plans via the natural language context.\n# OBJECTIVE #\n* Add only one more action to the given action plan sequence towards achieving the goal state.\n* Provide the action name and the objects that this action will interact with.\n* Evaluate the confidence score that continuing with the suggested action plan will eventually lead to the goal state.\n* Determine if the action plan has already reached the goal state.\n* Output only one action at each step and stop.\n* You should think step by step, you think think more steps. \n# STYLE #\nFollow the writing style of technical experts. The output can be parsed by a machine, so it is important to follow the structured format.\n# TONE #\nBe precise and concise in constructing the action plan sequence. Provide clear information about the objects involved, the numerical confidence score, and the boolean value for the goal state check.\n# AUDIENCE #\nYour audience is someone who is asking for a detailed action plan to solve sequential decision making problems. \n# RESPONSE #\nThe response should be in the following format:\n---\n**Response:**\n1. Action {n}: [Action Name]\n2. Objects: \n   - ?x - [type]: [object description]\n   - ...\n   \n3.

{"role": "user", "content": "Question: Here is the task.\nA natural language description of the domain\nDomain information: This domain is structured to allow organizing and managing books within a library setting. The actions and predicates support the movement of books between tables and shelves, ensuring that conditions like accessibility and the librarian's hands being free are met. Additionally, it includes managing book categories, shelf space, and check-out/return processes to reflect a more complex library system.\n\nA list of available predicates\n1. (on-shelf ?x ?y - book) ;; ?x is on top of ?y on the shelf\n2. (on-table ?x - book) ;; ?x is on the table\n3. (accessible ?x - book) ;; ?x is accessible (not covered)\n4. (hands-free) ;; The hands of the librarian are free\n5. (holding ?x - book) ;; The librarian is holding ?x\n6. (belongs-to-category ?x - book ?cat - category) ;; ?x belongs to the category ?cat\n7. (shelf-empty ?cat - category) ;; The shelf for category ?cat is empty\n8. (shelf-overflow ?cat - category) ;; The shelf for category ?cat is full\n9. (book-request ?book - book) ;; There is a request for book ?book\n10. (return-due ?book - book) ;; Book ?book is due for return\n11. (checked-out ?book - book) ;; Book ?book is checked out\n\nAction Description: \nAction Name: take-from-table\nAction Description: Pick up a book from the table if it's not covered and your hands are empty.\n\nAction Name: place-on-table\nAction Description: Put a book you're holding onto the table, making it accessible.\n\nAction Name: place-on-shelf\nAction Description: Put a book you're holding on top of another accessible book on the shelf.\n\nAction Name: remove-from-shelf\nAction Description: Pick up an accessible book from the shelf if your hands are empty, making the book underneath accessible.\n\nAction Name: check-out\nAction Description: Mark a book as borrowed by a patron, ensuring it's not already taken.\n\nAction Name: return-book\nAction Description: Record a book as returned by a patron when you're holding it.\n\n\n\nProblem Information: \n\nObject Snippet: (:objects\n    Book1 Book2 Book3 - book\n    Fiction Non_Fiction Reference - category\n)\n\n\nInitial State: In the library, there are three books: Book1, Book2, and Book3. Book3 is on top of Book1 and they are both on the shelf, while Book2 and Book1 are on the table. Both Book2 and Book3 are accessible, meaning they can be interacted with. The library worker's hands are free. Book1 belongs to the Fiction category, Book2 belongs to the NonFiction category, and Book3 belongs to the Reference category. All three categories (Fiction, NonFiction, and Reference) have empty shelves.\n\nGoal State: The goal is to have Book2 on top of Book3, and also Book1 on top of Book2.\n\nCurrent Action Plan:\nEmpty\n\nYour answer:\n"}
