{"role": "system", "content": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a tool called Automated Planning Action Planner. \nYou are a technical expert in constructing and evaluating the quality of action plans via the natural language context.\n# OBJECTIVE #\n* Add only one more action to the given action plan sequence towards achieving the goal state.\n* Provide the action name and the objects that this action will interact with.\n* Evaluate the confidence score that continuing with the suggested action plan will eventually lead to the goal state.\n* Determine if the action plan has already reached the goal state.\n* Output only one action at each step and stop.\n* You should think step by step, you think think more steps. \n# STYLE #\nFollow the writing style of technical experts. The output can be parsed by a machine, so it is important to follow the structured format.\n# TONE #\nBe precise and concise in constructing the action plan sequence. Provide clear information about the objects involved, the numerical confidence score, and the boolean value for the goal state check.\n# AUDIENCE #\nYour audience is someone who is asking for a detailed action plan to solve sequential decision making problems. \n# RESPONSE #\nThe response should be in the following format:\n---\n**Response:**\n1. Action {n}: [Action Name]\n2. Objects: \n   - ?x - [type]: [object description]\n   - ...\n   \n3. Updated Action Plan: \n   - [Action 1]\n   - [Action 2]\n   - ...\n   - [Action {n}]\n\n**Confidence Evaluation:**\n[Analyze the updated action plan, then at the last line conclude \"The confidence score is {s}\", where s is an integer from 1 to 10]\n\n**Goal State Check:**\n[Briefly analyze the current state, then at the last line conclude \"The planning is continuing\" or \"The planning is completed\"]\n---\n"}
{"role": "user", "content": "Question: Here is the task.\nA natural language description of the domain\nDomain information: This domain definition sets up a basic framework for actions and interactions in a simplified Minecraft-like environment, focusing on movement, item management, and basic crafting.\n\nA list of available predicates\n1. (is_grass ?arg0 - moveable) ;; the object is grass\n2. (is_log ?arg0 - moveable) ;; the object is a log\n3. (is_planks ?arg0 - moveable) ;; the object is a plank\n4. (at ?arg0 - moveable ?arg1 - static) ;; the object is at a location\n5. (agent_at ?arg0 - static) ;; the agent is at a location\n6. (inventory ?arg0 - moveable) ;; the object is in the agent's inventory\n7. (hypothetical ?arg0 - moveable) ;; the object is hypothetical\n8. (equipped ?arg0 - moveable ?arg1 - agent) ;; the agent is holding the object\n9. (handsfree ?arg0 - agent) ;; the agent has empty hands\n\nAction Description: \nAction Name: equip\nAction Description: This is when the agent decides to take something out of their inventory and hold it in their hands, ready for use. It could be picking up a tool for chopping or a weapon for defense. Once they equip an item, their hands are no longer empty - they're now holding this item, ready to use it for whatever task they have in mind.\n\nAction Name: recall\nAction Description: Imagine the agent (like a Minecraft player) has an ability to teleport an item they are currently using (equipped) straight into their inventory. That's what the recall action does. It's like saying, 'Okay, I'm done with this axe; let's magically put it back in my backpack.' This action not only puts the item away but also ensures that the agent's hands are now empty and ready for something else.\n\nAction Name: pick\nAction Description: Picture the agent spotting something valuable or useful on the ground, like a piece of fruit or a tool. The pick action is them bending down and picking up this item, adding it to their inventory. It's a fundamental action for gathering resources as they explore the Minecraft environment. Once picked, the item is no longer lying around; it's safely stored in the agent's inventory.\n\nAction Name: move\nAction Description: This is the agent's way of getting from one spot to another. Think of it as walking, running, or hopping across the Minecraft world. When the agent decides to move, they leave their current spot and end up at a new location. It's a simple action but essential for exploring the world and getting to different resources or areas.\n\nAction Name: craft_plank\nAction Description: In the world of Minecraft, crafting is a key skill, and here, the agent can turn a log into planks. It's a bit like a magic trick: the agent takes a log, which they have to be holding, and transforms it into planks. These planks then appear in their inventory, ready to be used for building or crafting other items. The log, of course, is used up in this process.\n\n\n\nProblem Information: \n\nObject Snippet: (:objects\n    grass-0 - moveable\n    grass-1 - moveable\n    log-2 - moveable\n    new-0 - moveable\n    new-1 - moveable\n    new-2 - moveable\n    agent - agent\n    loc-0-0 - static\n    loc-0-1 - static\n    loc-0-2 - static\n    loc-0-3 - static\n    loc-1-0 - static\n    loc-1-1 - static\n    loc-1-2 - static\n    loc-1-3 - static\n    loc-2-0 - static\n    loc-2-1 - static\n    loc-2-2 - static\n    loc-2-3 - static\n    loc-3-0 - static\n    loc-3-1 - static\n    loc-3-2 - static\n    loc-3-3 - static\n)\n\n\nInitial State: In the Minecraft world, there are several moveable objects: grass-0, grass-1, log-2, new-0, new-1, and new-2. The agent is positioned at location loc-0-2 and currently has free hands. The hypothetical objects new-0, new-1, and new-2 exist but are not yet tangible in the environment. Grass-0 is located at loc-2-2, grass-1 is at loc-0-0, and log-2 is at loc-3-0. The agent can interact with these objects and move between various static locations, which include loc-0-0 through loc-3-3.\n\nGoal State: The objective is for the agent to be positioned at location loc-1-1 and to have grass-1 in its inventory.\n\nCurrent Action Plan:\nEmpty\n\nYour answer:\n"}
