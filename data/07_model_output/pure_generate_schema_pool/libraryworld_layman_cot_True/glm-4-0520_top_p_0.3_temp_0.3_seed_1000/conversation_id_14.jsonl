{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you have a robot bartender tasked with making a special cocktail. It has a shot glass with an ingredient and needs to transfer this into a shaker to mix the drink properly. The action we're talking about is named \"pour-shot-to-clean-shaker.\"\n\nLet's break down the steps and rules (we call these \"preconditions\" and \"effects\") for this action using a simple scenario:\n\n1. **Preconditions (the rules that must be true before the action starts):**\n   - The robot must be holding the shot glass. This makes sense because it can't pour from the shot glass if it's not holding it!\n   - The shot glass must contain the ingredient it's supposed to pour. You wouldn't pour if the glass was empty, right?\n   - The shaker, where the ingredient will go, must be empty and clean. This ensures that previous contents don't mix with the new ingredient, keeping your drink as intended.\n   - The shaker must be at a certain level of fullness before pouring, and the robot knows what level comes next. This helps in measuring how much more it can add.\n\n2. **Effects (what happens after the action is performed):**\n   - The shot glass will no longer contain the ingredient because it's been poured out.\n   - The shot glass becomes empty because all its contents have been transferred.\n   - The shaker now contains the ingredient from the shot glass.\n   - The shaker is no longer empty or clean because it has something in it now.\n   - The shaker remains unshaken; just because the ingredient is added doesn't mean it's ready to drink. Mixing is a separate step!\n   - The level of the shaker changes to the next level, accounting for the added ingredient.\n\nBy setting these preconditions and effects, the robot knows exactly what to check and what changes to make in its environment to successfully make the cocktail. This careful planning ensures the drink is made correctly and efficiently, step by step.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?s - shot: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?i - ingredient: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?h1 - hand: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?h2 - hand: [short description of the parameter]\n5. ?d - dispenser: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (holding ?h1 ?s)\n    (handempty ?h2)\n    (dispenses ?d ?i)\n    (empty ?s)\n    (clean ?s)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (empty ?s))\n    (contains ?s ?i)\n    (not (clean ?s))\n    (used ?s ?i)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:** Imagine our robot barman in a kitchen where it needs to prepare a drink using a shot glass. The robot has two hands and can only use one hand to hold an item at a time. Here\u2019s why the robot needs to follow certain steps, called preconditions, before it can fill the shot glass, which is the goal of the \"fill-shot\" action.\n\nFirstly, the robot must be holding the shot glass with one hand, which we call ?h1. This is important because the robot can only fill something it is holding. The precondition `(holding ?h1 ?s)` ensures that the robot has a good grip on the shot glass before proceeding.\n\nSecondly, the other hand, ?h2, must be empty (`handempty ?h2`). This is because if the hand is already holding something else, the robot wouldn\u2019t be able to operate the dispenser properly or manage other tasks like adding more ingredients if needed.\n\nThe next precondition is that the dispenser identified as ?d must be capable of dispensing the ingredient ?i, as noted in `(dispenses ?d ?i)`. This ensures that the robot is at the right dispenser for the ingredient it needs to fill the shot glass with.\n\nAlso, the shot glass itself must be empty (`empty ?s`) and clean (`clean ?s`) before anything is poured into it. This is common sense, right? You wouldn\u2019t want to drink from a dirty or already filled glass! This makes sure the drink is clean and tastes as expected.\n\nAfter all these conditions are met, the robot can go ahead and fill the shot glass. The effects of this action include a few changes:\n- The shot glass is no longer empty (`not (empty ?s)`), meaning it now contains the ingredient.\n- The shot glass now contains the specific ingredient (`contains ?s ?i`), which is just like saying the glass now has, say, gin in it.\n- The glass is no longer clean (`not (clean ?s)`) because it now has something in it.\n- Lastly, the shot glass is marked as used for that particular ingredient (`used ?s ?i`), which helps the robot remember what has been done with that glass.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?s - shot: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?i - ingredient: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?d - shaker: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?h1 - hand: [short description of the parameter]\n5. ?l - level: [short description of the parameter]\n6. ?l1 - level: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (holding ?h1 ?s)\n    (contains ?s ?i)\n    (empty ?d)\n    (clean ?d)\n    (shaker-level ?d ?l)\n    (next ?l ?l1)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (contains ?s ?i))\n    (empty ?s)\n    (contains ?d ?i)\n    (not (empty ?d))\n    (not (clean ?d))\n    (unshaked ?d)\n    (not (shaker-level ?d ?l))\n    (shaker-level ?d ?l1)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine you want to move a toy train (representing the hoist) from one side of your playroom (a store area) to another. Before moving it, you need to make sure of a few things:\n\n1. **The train is actually at the starting point:** Just like you need to know where your train is before you can move it, the action schema checks if the hoist is at the starting store area (`at ?h ?from`). This ensures that we are moving the right hoist from the correct location.\n\n2. **The destination is clear:** Imagine if the place you wanted to move your train to was already full of other toys. You wouldn\u2019t be able to put your train there, right? Similarly, the schema requires the destination store area to be clear (`clear ?to`) so that the hoist can move there without any issues.\n\n3. **The starting and destination points are connected:** It\u2019s like making sure there\u2019s a clear path or a track between where your train is and where you want it to go. If there\u2019s no track, you can't move the train. In the action schema, this is checked by the condition (`connected ?from ?to`).\n\nNow, when the train (hoist) moves:\n- **It is no longer at the starting point:** Just like when your train leaves one side of the room, it\u2019s not there anymore. This change is shown in the schema by removing the condition that the hoist is at the starting area (`not (at ?h ?from)`).\n  \n- **It is now at the destination:** When you move your train to the other side of the room, it\u2019s now there. This is represented in the schema by adding the condition that the hoist is now at the destination area (`at ?h ?to`).\n\n- **The destination is no longer clear:** Now that the train is at the new spot, that area isn\u2019t empty anymore. This change is reflected by removing the 'clear' condition for the destination area (`not (clear ?to)`).\n\n- **The starting point becomes clear:** Since the train left the starting area, that spot is now free. This is captured by adding a 'clear' condition for the starting area (`clear ?from`).\n\nThis whole process helps ensure that the hoist can safely and efficiently move from one area to another without confusion or conflicts.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?h - hoist: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?c - crate: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?a1 - store_area: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?a2 - area: [short description of the parameter]\n5. ?p - place: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (connected ?a1 ?a2)\n    (at ?h ?a2)\n    (available ?h)\n    (on ?c ?a1)\n    (store_area_in ?a1 ?p)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (on ?c ?a1))\n    (clear ?a1)\n    (not (available ?h))\n    (lifting ?h ?c)\n    (not (crate_in ?c ?p))\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

Its job is to move from one specific area where it usually stores things, called a store area, to another area meant for transitioning goods, which we call a transit area. Now, this action of moving from the store area to the transit area is called \"go-out.\"\n\nTo make sure this action goes smoothly, there are a few things that need to be in place beforehand, which we call preconditions. First, our little hoist needs to be at the store area to start with\u2014if it\u2019s somewhere else, it can\u2019t start moving from the store area, right? That's like saying you need to be at home to start walking to the park. Secondly, the store area and the transit area need to be connected. If there's no path or door between them, our hoist can't get to the transit area. It's a bit like needing a road or a path to walk on.\n\nNow, when the hoist successfully moves to the transit area, we have some changes that occur, which are the effects of the action. The hoist is no longer in the store area (it has moved, after all), and it's now in the transit area. This is straightforward: the hoist was here, and now it\u2019s there. Additionally, the store area becomes 'clear' or empty because the hoist has moved out. This is like saying that once you leave your room, the room is empty.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"go-out\" action moves our hoist from one area to another and makes sure the starting area is free for other activities. This helps keep things organized and running smoothly in our warehouse scenario.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?h - hoist: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?from - store_area: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?to - transit_area: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (at ?h ?from)\n    (connected ?from ?to)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (at ?h ?from))\n    (at ?h ?to)\n    (clear ?from)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

This toy truck represents the hoist, and the corners of the room are like different storage areas in our description.\n\n1. **Preconditions:**\n   - **Hoist is at the source area (at ?h ?from):** This condition makes sure that the hoist is actually at the starting point (like making sure your toy truck is really in the corner where you want to start moving it from). This is necessary because you can't move something from a place it isn't already at.\n   - **Destination area is clear (clear ?to):** This is like making sure that the corner you want to move your toy truck to doesn\u2019t have any obstacles or other toys in the way. The space needs to be clear so the hoist can move in without any issues.\n   - **Areas are connected (connected ?from ?to):** This checks if there is a direct path from the starting point to the destination, similar to making sure there's a clear path on the floor between the two corners of the room for the toy truck to travel without hitting a wall or furniture.\n\n2. **Effects:**\n   - **Hoist moves to the destination (at ?h ?to):** This is like saying your toy truck is now in the new corner of the room.\n   - **Hoist is no longer at the source (not (at ?h ?from)):** Just like your toy truck can't be in two places at once, when the hoist moves to the new area, it's no longer in the original area.\n   - **Destination area is no longer clear (not (clear ?to)):** Now that the hoist (or your toy truck) is in the new corner, that corner isn't empty anymore.\n   - **Source area becomes clear (clear ?from):** Since the hoist has moved away from the original area, that area is now free of obstacles or the hoist itself.\n\nSo, in simple terms, this action is like moving a toy from one clear, connected corner of the room to another. Before you move it, you need to check that it\u2019s starting in the right place, that there\u2019s no blockage where it\u2019s going, and that it can directly reach there.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nImagine a robot bartender at a busy party, tasked with making a variety of drinks. This robot, like a human bartender, has hands that it uses to pick up things like glasses or shakers.\n\nIn the scenario we're discussing, the action we're focusing on is called \"grasp,\" where the robot uses its hand to pick up a container from a table. Let's break down why certain conditions need to be met for this action to happen successfully and what happens after the robot performs this action.\n\n**Why the preconditions are necessary:**\n1. **The container must be on the table (ontable ?c):** This makes sense because if the container isn't on the table, the robot wouldn't know where to find it. It needs to be in a predictable location that the robot can access.\n2. **The robot's hand must be empty (handempty ?h):** Before the robot can pick up something new, its hand needs to be empty. Just like you can't pick up a cup of coffee if you're already holding an apple in your hand, the robot needs a free hand to pick up a new container.\n\n**What happens after the action (effects):**\n1. **The container is no longer on the table (not (ontable ?c)):** Once the robot picks up the container, it's no longer sitting on the table. It's in the robot's hand.\n2. **The robot's hand is no longer empty (not (handempty ?h)):** With the container in its hand, the hand isn't empty anymore.\n3. **The robot's hand is holding the container (holding ?h ?c):** This describes the new status of the robot\u2019s hand\u2014it is actively holding onto the container.\n\nSo, in this action, we see the robot checking that the container is where it's supposed to be and making sure its hand is ready to pick something up. Once those conditions are met, the robot can safely pick up the container, changing both the status of the container and the status of its hand. This is very practical and logical, ensuring that the robot operates efficiently and correctly in its environment of serving drinks at the party.\n\nThis action schema helps in planning out the robot's movements in a logical sequence, ensuring it always knows what to do next, based on simple checks and changes (preconditions and effects).\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?s - shot: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?b - beverage: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?h1 - hand: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?h2 - hand: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (holding ?h1 ?s)\n    (handempty ?h2)\n    (empty ?s)\n    (used ?s ?b)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (used ?s ?b))\n    (clean ?s)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

The robot needs to clean a used shot glass to make sure it's ready for the next drink. This situation leads us to create an action called `clean-shot` in the robot's planning.\n\nFirst, the robot needs to make sure it's holding the shot glass with one hand (`holding ?h1 ?s`). This makes sense because you need to hold the glass to clean it properly.\n\nNext, the robot needs to have its other hand free (`handempty ?h2`). This is important because the robot might need to use this hand to operate cleaning tools or to stabilize the glass while cleaning.\n\nThe glass itself must be empty (`empty ?s`) before it can be cleaned. Imagine trying to clean a glass while it's still full of liquid; it would be messy and ineffective!\n\nLastly, the glass should have been used (`used ?s ?b`), indicating it was previously filled with a drink and now requires cleaning. This precondition checks whether the glass actually needs cleaning.\n\nOnce all these conditions are met, the robot can proceed with the cleaning action. The effect of this action is twofold: the shot glass is no longer 'used' for the specific beverage (`not (used ?s ?b)`), and the glass becomes clean (`clean ?s`).\n\nBy setting these preconditions and effects, we ensure that the robot performs the cleaning task effectively and prepares the glass for future use, maintaining a smooth operation in the bar scenario.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?h - hand: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?c - container: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (ontable ?c)\n    (handempty ?h)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (ontable ?c))\n    (not (handempty ?h))\n    (holding ?h ?c)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nImagine you're teaching a robot how to serve drinks at a party. The robot is designed to perform specific tasks with clear instructions, much like following a recipe step-by-step.\n\n**Scenario:** The robot needs to pour a beverage from a shaker into a shot glass. The action it must perform is called \"pour-shaker-to-shot.\"\n\n**Why the Preconditions are Necessary:**\n1. **Holding the Shaker:** The robot must be holding the shaker to pour from it. If it's not holding it, it can't control the pouring process.\n2. **Shaker is Shaken:** The contents in the shaker need to be mixed well (shaken) before serving. This ensures the drink's quality and consistency.\n3. **The Shot Glass is Empty:** The glass must be empty because pouring into an already full or partially filled glass would cause a spill or mix drinks unintentionally.\n4. **The Shot Glass is Clean:** Hygiene and taste! No one wants a dirty glass, and leftover residues could alter the flavor of the new drink.\n5. **Shaker Contains the Beverage:** The robot needs to confirm that the right beverage is in the shaker to pour the correct drink.\n6. **Shaker Level is Correct:** Knowing the current level helps manage how much is poured, ensuring the robot doesn't try to pour more than what is available.\n7. **Next Level Indicator:** This indicates how much beverage will remain in the shaker after pouring, helping in planning the next steps or refilling.\n\n**How the Preconditions Lead to the Specified Effects:**\n- After the robot pours, the shot glass will no longer be clean and empty because it now contains the beverage.\n- The level of the beverage in the shaker decreases as it has been transferred to the glass.\n- The robot updates the shaker's level to reflect the new quantity, which is crucial for knowing how much is left for the next drink.\n\n**Simple Analogy:**\nThink of it like pouring apple juice for a kid. You need to make sure you have the juice (in a jug), a clean and empty cup to pour into, and you need to be holding the jug. After pouring, the cup will have juice, and there'll be less juice in the jug. Just like you need to check these things, so does the robot!\n\nBy setting up these instructions in the action \"pour-shaker-to-shot,\" we ensure the robot does its job correctly and efficiently, just like you'd carefully prepare a drink for a guest.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?h - hand: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?p - shot: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?b - beverage: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (holding ?h ?p)\n    (contains ?p ?b)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (contains ?p ?b))\n    (empty ?p)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

Now, let\u2019s think about the action of the robot emptying a shot glass it is holding, which is named \"empty-shot\" in our planning scenario.\n\n**Why these preconditions?**\n1. The robot needs to be holding the shot glass. This is pretty straightforward: if the robot isn't holding the glass, it can\u2019t empty it. It\u2019s like you needing to hold a cup in your hand if you want to pour out its contents.\n2. The shot glass must contain a beverage. Again, this makes sense because if the glass is already empty, there's nothing to pour out!\n\n**How do these preconditions lead to the effects?**\n1. The effect that the shot glass no longer contains the beverage (`not (contains ?p ?b)`) directly follows from the action of emptying it. When you pour out a drink, the cup turns from being full to being empty.\n2. The shot glass is then marked as empty (`empty ?p`). This tells everyone (or every robot and system involved) that the glass is now ready to be used again, perhaps to be refilled or cleaned.\n\nSo, by ensuring the robot is holding a shot glass that contains a drink, and by performing the action of emptying it, the robot effectively makes the shot glass available for the next use, fulfilling its role as a bartender robot. It's like making sure a painter has a clean brush to start a new painting, ensuring the right tools are ready for the next task.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?b - beverage: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?d - shot: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?h - hand: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?s - shaker: [short description of the parameter]\n5. ?l - level: [short description of the parameter]\n6. ?l1 - level: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (holding ?h ?s)\n    (shaked ?s)\n    (empty ?d)\n    (clean ?d)\n    (contains ?s ?b)\n    (shaker-level ?s ?l)\n    (next ?l1 ?l)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (clean ?d))\n    (not (empty ?d))\n    (contains ?d ?b)\n    (shaker-level ?s ?l1)\n    (not (shaker-level ?s ?l))\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **The robot must be at the loading area** (transit_area): This is pretty straightforward. If the robot isn't at the loading area, it can't start moving towards the storage area because it's simply not there to begin the task.\n\n2. **The loading area and storage area must be connected**: It's like making sure there's a clear path or a road between two places before you start driving.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine you want to move a toy train (representing the hoist) from one side of your playroom (a store area) to another. Before moving it, you need to make sure of a few things:\n\n1. **The train is actually at the starting point:** Just like you need to know where your train is before you can move it, the action schema checks if the hoist is at the starting store area (`at ?h ?from`). This ensures that we are moving the right hoist from the correct location.\n\n2. **The destination is clear:** Imagine if the place you wanted to move your train to was already full of other toys. You wouldn\u2019t be able to put your train there, right? Similarly, the schema requires the destination store area to be clear (`clear ?to`) so that the hoist can move there without any issues.\n\n3. **The starting and destination points are connected:** It\u2019s like making sure there\u2019s a clear path or a track between where your train is and where you want it to go. If there\u2019s no track, you can't move the train. In the action schema, this is checked by the condition (`connected ?from ?to`).\n\nNow, when the train (hoist) moves:\n- **It is no longer at the starting point:** Just like when your train leaves one side of the room, it\u2019s not there anymore. This change is shown in the schema by removing the condition that the hoist is at the starting area (`not (at ?h ?from)`).\n  \n- **It is now at the destination:** When you move your train to the other side of the room, it\u2019s now there. This is represented in the schema by adding the condition that the hoist is now at the destination area (`at ?h ?to`).\n\n- **The destination is no longer clear:** Now that the train is at the new spot, that area isn\u2019t empty anymore. This change is reflected by removing the 'clear' condition for the destination area (`not (clear ?to)`).\n\n- **The starting point becomes clear:** Since the train left the starting area, that spot is now free.

Let's break down why certain conditions need to be met for this action to happen successfully and what happens after the robot performs this action.\n\n**Why the preconditions are necessary:**\n1. **The container must be on the table (ontable ?c):** This makes sense because if the container isn't on the table, the robot wouldn't know where to find it. It needs to be in a predictable location that the robot can access.\n2. **The robot's hand must be empty (handempty ?h):** Before the robot can pick up something new, its hand needs to be empty.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nImagine a robot barman at work in a busy cocktail bar. The robot is tasked with making drinks using various tools, including a shaker that needs to be clean before it can be used to mix ingredients. Let's consider why the robot would need specific conditions to be met before it can clean the shaker, as described in the action schema called \"clean-shaker.\"\n\n1. **Why the shaker needs to be held and the other hand empty**: The action requires the robot to hold the shaker with one hand (`holding ?h1 ?s`) and have the other hand empty (`handempty ?h2`). This makes sense because the robot can only use one hand to perform the cleaning while needing the other hand free, possibly to manipulate cleaning tools or to stabilize the shaker.\n\n2. **Why the shaker must be empty**: It's also specified that the shaker needs to be empty before it can be cleaned (`empty ?s`). This is crucial because cleaning a shaker that still has something in it would not only be inefficient but also could cause a mess and waste ingredients. The robot needs to ensure the shaker is empty to effectively clean it for the next drink preparation.\n\n3. **The effect of the action**: Once these conditions are met, the effect of the robot's action is that the shaker becomes clean (`clean ?s`). This state change is vital because a clean shaker ensures that the drinks made are fresh and uncontaminated by previous ingredients.\n\nBy setting these preconditions, the action schema makes sure that the robot operates logically and efficiently, avoiding potential errors like trying to clean a shaker that is not yet empty or held properly. This careful planning helps the robot succeed in its role as a barman, ensuring happy customers with well-made cocktails.\n\nIn simpler terms, it's like making sure you've got all your ingredients ready and your cooking space organized before you start making a meal.

The robot needs to follow certain steps to make sure everything goes smoothly and safely, just like following a recipe.\n\nThe action \"empty-shaker\" is all about the robot taking a shaker that has already been shaken (which means the ingredients are mixed up properly) and emptying it out so that the drink can be served, and the shaker is ready to be cleaned and used again.\n\nNow, let's talk about the preconditions, which are like the 'must-haves' before the robot can start this action:\n1. **(holding ?h ?s)** - The robot must be holding the shaker. It can\u2019t empty it if it\u2019s not holding it, right? Just like you can't pour milk from a jug if you're not holding it.\n2. **(contains ?s ?b)** - The shaker needs to have a drink inside. There's no point in trying to empty something that's already empty.\n3. **(shaked ?s)** - The drink inside the shaker must be mixed up by shaking. This ensures the drink is ready to be served.\n4. **(shaker-level ?s ?l)** - This tells us how much drink is currently in the shaker. It\u2019s important to know this so the robot knows it\u2019s actually pouring something out.\n5. **(shaker-empty-level ?s ?l1)** - This indicates what the level of the shaker should be after emptying it. Usually, it means it will be empty or nearly empty.\n\nThe effects of the action describe what changes after the robot empties the shaker:\n1. **(not (shaked ?s))** - The shaker is no longer considered 'shaken' because it's been emptied.\n2. **(not (shaker-level ?s ?l))** - The previous level of the drink is no longer relevant because it's been poured out.\n3. **(shaker-level ?s ?l1)** - This updates the level of the shaker to show it's now empty or at the lower level expected.\n4. **(not (contains ?s ?b))** - The shaker no longer contains the drink because it\u2019s been poured out.\n5. **(empty ?s)** - Finally, the shaker is empty, ready to be washed and used again for the next drink.\n\nBy ensuring all these preconditions are met before the action and then updating everything as described in the effects, the robot efficiently manages its tasks without any mix-ups or errors, just like a good cook keeps their kitchen in order.
