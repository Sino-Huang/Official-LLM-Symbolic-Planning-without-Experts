In our plan, there's a special task called `serve_sandwich_no_gluten`, which is like a set of instructions to make sure these kids get the right sandwich safely and happily.\n\n1. **Understanding the Ingredients and the Setting**:\n   - **Child and Place**: First, we need a child who is allergic to gluten and waiting at a specific place.\n   - **Sandwich and Tray**: We also need a sandwich that is gluten-free and placed on a tray.\n   - **Tray's Location**: The tray with the sandwich needs to be at the same place where the child is waiting.\n\n2. **Action Steps (Preconditions)**:\n   - The child must be allergic to gluten (`allergic_gluten ?c`). This tells us to be extra careful with this child's food.\n   - The gluten-free sandwich should be on the tray (`ontray ?s ?t`), ready to be served.\n   - The child should be waiting at a specific spot (`waiting ?c ?p`), ready to receive their sandwich.\n   - The sandwich needs to be gluten-free (`no_gluten_sandwich ?s`), so it's safe for the child.\n   - The tray with the sandwich has to be at the same place as the waiting child (`at ?t ?p`), so it's easy to serve.\n\n3. **What Happens After the Action (Effects)**:\n   - The sandwich is taken off the tray (`not (ontray ?s ?t)`), because it's being given to the child.\n   - The child is considered served (`served ?c`), meaning they've happily received their sandwich and can start enjoying their meal.\n\nIn simple terms, this action ensures that a child who cannot eat gluten gets a safe, gluten-free sandwich right where they're waiting, and then we mark that they've been served. It's all about making sure everyone at the picnic has a good time with the right food for them!\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?s - sandwich: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?c - child: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?t - tray: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?p - place: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (not_allergic_gluten ?c)\n    (waiting ?c ?p)\n    (ontray ?s ?t)\n    (at ?t ?p)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (ontray ?s ?t))\n    (served ?c)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nThe action schema you've described, \"serve_sandwich,\" is designed to model the process of serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten at a specific location, while also ensuring the sandwich is removed from the tray after serving. Let's break it down into simpler parts to understand how this works.\n\n1. **Parameters of the Action:**\n   - The action involves four main elements: a sandwich (`?s`), a child (`?c`), a tray (`?t`), and a place (`?p`). These elements are necessary to specify who gets the sandwich, where they get it, and how the sandwich is served.\n\n2. **Preconditions of the Action:**\n   - **Child is not allergic to gluten (`not_allergic_gluten ?c`):** Before serving the sandwich, it's crucial to make sure that the child does not have a gluten allergy. This avoids any health issues.\n   - **Child is waiting (`waiting ?c ?p`):** The child must be waiting at a specific place. This condition ensures that the child is ready to receive the sandwich.\n   - **Sandwich is on the tray (`ontray ?s ?t`):** This checks that the sandwich is available on the tray, indicating it's prepared and ready to be served.\n   - **Tray is at the same place as the child (`at ?t ?p`):** The tray with the sandwich must be in the same location as the waiting child to ensure that the sandwich can be handed over directly.\n\n3. **Effects of the Action:**\n   - **Removing the sandwich from the tray (`not (ontray ?s ?t)`):** Once the sandwich is served, this effect updates the situation by noting that the sandwich is no longer on the tray.\n   - **Child is served (`served ?c`):** This records that the child has now been served the sandwich, fulfilling part of the goal in the sandwich serving scenario.\n\nOverall, this action schema helps coordinate the task of serving sandwiches safely and efficiently, taking into account the location of the child and their dietary restrictions. It ensures that each step is validated before the sandwich is served, and it records the change in the situation once the action is completed. This systematic approach helps in planning and executing tasks without errors, especially in scenarios involving food safety and children's health.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?s - sandwich: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?c - child: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?t - tray: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?p - place: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (allergic_gluten ?c)\n    (ontray ?s ?t)\n    (waiting ?c ?p)\n    (no_gluten_sandwich ?s)\n    (at ?t ?p)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (ontray ?s ?t))\n    (served ?c)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine a scenario in a warehouse where a hoist is used to move crates from one area to another, like moving a box of toys from a shelf to a play area. The action we're talking about is called \"drop,\" where the hoist places a crate into a designated storage area.\n\n1. **Preconditions Explained:**\n   - **Connected Areas:** First, the hoist can only drop the crate if the area it\u2019s in (let's call it the play area) is connected to the area where the hoist is currently located (like the shelf area). This means there must be a clear path for the hoist to move the crate to its destination.\n   - **Hoist Location:** The hoist must be in the area adjacent to where the crate needs to go. If our hoist isn't next to the play area, it can't drop the crate there.\n   - **Hoist Lifting the Crate:** Before dropping, the hoist must already be lifting a crate. It's like making sure the hoist has picked up the box of toys before it can put it down.\n   - **Clear Storage Area:** The destination, where the crate will be placed, must be clear of other objects. This ensures there's space to safely place the new crate without stacking or causing a mess.\n   - **Store Area in Place:** The storage area where the crate is to be dropped needs to be part of the larger place being managed. This is like ensuring the play area is actually a part of the designated playroom.\n\n2. **Effects Explained:**\n   - **Hoist No Longer Lifting:** Once the crate is dropped, the hoist is no longer lifting it. This is like putting down the box of toys.\n   - **Hoist Becomes Available:** After dropping off the crate, the hoist is now free to take on other tasks, like picking up another box.\n   - **Storage Area Not Clear Anymore:** Since the crate has been placed there, the storage area is no longer empty.\n   - **Crate on Storage Area:** The crate is now officially in the storage area, like the box of toys now being in the play area.\n   - **Crate Location Updated:** We update the records to show that the crate is now in this new location within the place, which helps in managing space and knowing where everything is.\n\nThis action of dropping a crate involves several steps and conditions that ensure everything happens smoothly and safely, from ensuring there's a path to the hoist being ready and the space being available for the new crate.

Its job is to move from one specific area where it usually stores things, called a store area, to another area meant for transitioning goods, which we call a transit area. Now, this action of moving from the store area to the transit area is called \"go-out.\"\n\nTo make sure this action goes smoothly, there are a few things that need to be in place beforehand, which we call preconditions. First, our little hoist needs to be at the store area to start with\u2014if it\u2019s somewhere else, it can\u2019t start moving from the store area, right? That's like saying you need to be at home to start walking to the park. Secondly, the store area and the transit area need to be connected. If there's no path or door between them, our hoist can't get to the transit area. It's a bit like needing a road or a path to walk on.\n\nNow, when the hoist successfully moves to the transit area, we have some changes that occur, which are the effects of the action. The hoist is no longer in the store area (it has moved, after all), and it's now in the transit area. This is straightforward: the hoist was here, and now it\u2019s there. Additionally, the store area becomes 'clear' or empty because the hoist has moved out. This is like saying that once you leave your room, the room is empty.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"go-out\" action moves our hoist from one area to another and makes sure the starting area is free for other activities.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nThe action schema you've described, \"serve_sandwich,\" is designed to model the process of serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten at a specific location, while also ensuring the sandwich is removed from the tray after serving. Let's break it down into simpler parts to understand how this works.\n\n1. **Parameters of the Action:**\n   - The action involves four main elements: a sandwich (`?s`), a child (`?c`), a tray (`?t`), and a place (`?p`). These elements are necessary to specify who gets the sandwich, where they get it, and how the sandwich is served.\n\n2. **Preconditions of the Action:**\n   - **Child is not allergic to gluten (`not_allergic_gluten ?c`):** Before serving the sandwich, it's crucial to make sure that the child does not have a gluten allergy. This avoids any health issues.\n   - **Child is waiting (`waiting ?c ?p`):** The child must be waiting at a specific place. This condition ensures that the child is ready to receive the sandwich.\n   - **Sandwich is on the tray (`ontray ?s ?t`):** This checks that the sandwich is available on the tray, indicating it's prepared and ready to be served.\n   - **Tray is at the same place as the child (`at ?t ?p`):** The tray with the sandwich must be in the same location as the waiting child to ensure that the sandwich can be handed over directly.\n\n3. **Effects of the Action:**\n   - **Removing the sandwich from the tray (`not (ontray ?s ?t)`):** Once the sandwich is served, this effect updates the situation by noting that the sandwich is no longer on the tray.\n   - **Child is served (`served ?c`):** This records that the child has now been served the sandwich, fulfilling part of the goal in the sandwich serving scenario.\n\nOverall, this action schema helps coordinate the task of serving sandwiches safely and efficiently, taking into account the location of the child and their dietary restrictions. It ensures that each step is validated before the sandwich is served, and it records the change in the situation once the action is completed. This systematic approach helps in planning and executing tasks without errors, especially in scenarios involving food safety and children's health.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?s - sandwich: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?c - child: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?t - tray: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?p - place: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (not_allergic_gluten ?c)\n    (waiting ?c ?p)\n    (ontray ?s ?t)\n    (at ?t ?p)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (ontray ?s ?t))\n    (served ?c)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine you're helping out in a kitchen where you're preparing sandwiches for a party. Now, one of your tasks is to move a sandwich from the kitchen counter (where it was made) to a serving tray that's also in the kitchen. This simple task in real life is what the action \"put_on_tray\" represents in our planning domain.\n\nIn this specific scenario, we have two main things to check before you can put the sandwich on the tray:\n1. **The sandwich must be in the kitchen.** This is pretty straightforward, right? You need to know where the sandwich is to be able to pick it up and move it. In the domain model, this is captured by the condition `(at_kitchen_sandwich ?s)`. It just means, \"Check if the sandwich is at the kitchen.\"\n   \n2. **The tray must be in the kitchen.** Similarly, you need the tray to be in the kitchen as well. You can't put a sandwich on a tray that's not there! This condition is written as `(at ?t kitchen)` in the model. It's a way of saying, \"Make sure that the tray is at the kitchen.\"\n\nNow, once you've confirmed both conditions\u2014sandwich is in the kitchen and so is the tray\u2014you can go ahead and place the sandwich on the tray. What happens then? In the real world, the sandwich is no longer just 'sitting in the kitchen'; it's now on the tray. In the domain model, this change is described by the effects of the action:\n- **The sandwich is no longer just in the kitchen.** This is represented by `(not (at_kitchen_sandwich ?s))`. It means, \"The sandwich is no longer at the kitchen counter.\"\n- **The sandwich is now on the tray.** This is shown by `(ontray ?s ?t)`. It simply says, \"Now, the sandwich is on the tray.\"\n\nBy modeling it this way, the planning system understands exactly what conditions need to be true to perform the action (moving a sandwich onto a tray), and what changes happen after the action is taken. This helps in planning out all the steps needed to prepare and serve sandwiches efficiently, especially in a scenario where you might need to consider dietary restrictions like gluten allergies.\n\nSo, in summary, the action \"put_on_tray\" checks if both the sandwich and the tray are in the kitchen, and then updates their status to reflect that the sandwich has been moved onto the tray. This is crucial for ensuring that everything is ready and in the right place for the next steps, like serving the sandwiches to the children.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?s - sandwich: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?t - tray: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (at_kitchen_sandwich ?s)\n    (at ?t kitchen)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (at_kitchen_sandwich ?s))\n    (ontray ?s ?t)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

Let's break it down into simpler parts to understand how this works.\n\n1. **Parameters of the Action:**\n   - The action involves four main elements: a sandwich (`?s`), a child (`?c`), a tray (`?t`), and a place (`?p`). These elements are necessary to specify who gets the sandwich, where they get it, and how the sandwich is served.\n\n2. **Preconditions of the Action:**\n   - **Child is not allergic to gluten (`not_allergic_gluten ?c`):** Before serving the sandwich, it's crucial to make sure that the child does not have a gluten allergy. This avoids any health issues.\n   - **Child is waiting (`waiting ?c ?p`):** The child must be waiting at a specific place. This condition ensures that the child is ready to receive the sandwich.\n   - **Sandwich is on the tray (`ontray ?s ?t`):** This checks that the sandwich is available on the tray, indicating it's prepared and ready to be served.\n   - **Tray is at the same place as the child (`at ?t ?p`):** The tray with the sandwich must be in the same location as the waiting child to ensure that the sandwich can be handed over directly.\n\n3. **Effects of the Action:**\n   - **Removing the sandwich from the tray (`not (ontray ?s ?t)`):** Once the sandwich is served, this effect updates the situation by noting that the sandwich is no longer on the tray.\n   - **Child is served (`served ?c`):** This records that the child has now been served the sandwich, fulfilling part of the goal in the sandwich serving scenario.\n\nOverall, this action schema helps coordinate the task of serving sandwiches safely and efficiently, taking into account the location of the child and their dietary restrictions.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine a scenario in a warehouse where a hoist is used to move crates from one area to another, like moving a box of toys from a shelf to a play area. The action we're talking about is called \"drop,\" where the hoist places a crate into a designated storage area.\n\n1. **Preconditions Explained:**\n   - **Connected Areas:** First, the hoist can only drop the crate if the area it\u2019s in (let's call it the play area) is connected to the area where the hoist is currently located (like the shelf area). This means there must be a clear path for the hoist to move the crate to its destination.\n   - **Hoist Location:** The hoist must be in the area adjacent to where the crate needs to go. If our hoist isn't next to the play area, it can't drop the crate there.\n   - **Hoist Lifting the Crate:** Before dropping, the hoist must already be lifting a crate. It's like making sure the hoist has picked up the box of toys before it can put it down.\n   - **Clear Storage Area:** The destination, where the crate will be placed, must be clear of other objects. This ensures there's space to safely place the new crate without stacking or causing a mess.\n   - **Store Area in Place:** The storage area where the crate is to be dropped needs to be part of the larger place being managed. This is like ensuring the play area is actually a part of the designated playroom.\n\n2. **Effects Explained:**\n   - **Hoist No Longer Lifting:** Once the crate is dropped, the hoist is no longer lifting it. This is like putting down the box of toys.\n   - **Hoist Becomes Available:** After dropping off the crate, the hoist is now free to take on other tasks, like picking up another box.\n   - **Storage Area Not Clear Anymore:** Since the crate has been placed there, the storage area is no longer empty.\n   - **Crate on Storage Area:** The crate is now officially in the storage area, like the box of toys now being in the play area.\n   - **Crate Location Updated:** We update the records to show that the crate is now in this new location within the place, which helps in managing space and knowing where everything is.\n\nThis action of dropping a crate involves several steps and conditions that ensure everything happens smoothly and safely, from ensuring there's a path to the hoist being ready and the space being available for the new crate.

This is necessary because you can't move something from a place it isn't already at.\n   - **Destination area is clear (clear ?to):** This is like making sure that the corner you want to move your toy truck to doesn\u2019t have any obstacles or other toys in the way. The space needs to be clear so the hoist can move in without any issues.\n   - **Areas are connected (connected ?from ?to):** This checks if there is a direct path from the starting point to the destination, similar to making sure there's a clear path on the floor between the two corners of the room for the toy truck to travel without hitting a wall or furniture.\n\n2. **Effects:**\n   - **Hoist moves to the destination (at ?h ?to):** This is like saying your toy truck is now in the new corner of the room.\n   - **Hoist is no longer at the source (not (at ?h ?from)):** Just like your toy truck can't be in two places at once, when the hoist moves to the new area, it's no longer in the original area.\n   - **Destination area is no longer clear (not (clear ?to)):** Now that the hoist (or your toy truck) is in the new corner, that corner isn't empty anymore.\n   - **Source area becomes clear (clear ?from):** Since the hoist has moved away from the original area, that area is now free of obstacles or the hoist itself.\n\nSo, in simple terms, this action is like moving a toy from one clear, connected corner of the room to another.

This condition ensures that the child is ready to receive the sandwich.\n   - **Sandwich is on the tray (`ontray ?s ?t`):** This checks that the sandwich is available on the tray, indicating it's prepared and ready to be served.\n   - **Tray is at the same place as the child (`at ?t ?p`):** The tray with the sandwich must be in the same location as the waiting child to ensure that the sandwich can be handed over directly.\n\n3. **Effects of the Action:**\n   - **Removing the sandwich from the tray (`not (ontray ?s ?t)`):** Once the sandwich is served, this effect updates the situation by noting that the sandwich is no longer on the tray.\n   - **Child is served (`served ?c`):** This records that the child has now been served the sandwich, fulfilling part of the goal in the sandwich serving scenario.\n\nOverall, this action schema helps coordinate the task of serving sandwiches safely and efficiently, taking into account the location of the child and their dietary restrictions. It ensures that each step is validated before the sandwich is served, and it records the change in the situation once the action is completed.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nIn the dungeon domain, the hero needs to be strategic about when and where to use the sword, as actions can have consequences depending on the hero's surroundings.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you're in a kitchen, ready to make a sandwich. You need two main things to start: a portion of bread and some filling, which we'll call the content. In the domain we're talking about, the task is to make sandwiches, ensuring that all the bread and content are there before you begin. This setup helps in organizing how sandwiches are made and ensures that ingredients are used properly.\n\nIn the action named `make_sandwich`, the goal is to create a sandwich using these ingredients. Let's break down the action into steps, much like following a recipe:\n\n1. **Parameters:** These are like the ingredients listed at the start of a recipe. For this action, the ingredients (parameters) are a sandwich (`?s`), a bread portion (`?b`), and a content portion (`?c`).\n\n2. **Preconditions:** Before you can make a sandwich, you need to make sure you have everything you need. In this case, the preconditions are that:\n   - The bread portion (`?b`) is available in the kitchen. This is checked with `(at_kitchen_bread ?b)`.\n   - The content portion (`?c`) is also available in the kitchen, checked by `(at_kitchen_content ?c)`.\n   - The sandwich you're going to make (`?s`) doesn't already exist. This prevents making duplicate sandwiches and is checked by `(not_exist ?s)`.\n\n3. **Effects:** After making the sandwich, the action results in changes, like steps in a recipe telling you what to do next:\n   - The bread portion (`?b`) used is no longer available in the kitchen. This is noted by `(not (at_kitchen_bread ?b))`, meaning the bread is now part of the sandwich.\n   - Similarly, the content (`?c`) is used up and thus not available as a separate item, noted by `(not (at_kitchen_content ?c))`.\n   - A new sandwich (`?s`) is now available in the kitchen, checked by `(at_kitchen_sandwich ?s)`.\n   - Since the sandwich is made, it now exists, changing the state from `(not_exist ?s)` to its negation, indicating the sandwich's presence.\n\nThrough these steps, the action of making a sandwich is clearly defined from start to finish, ensuring that all necessary ingredients are used appropriately and result in a final product\u2014a sandwich ready to be served!\n\nThis methodical approach ensures everything is in order before starting and reflects accurately in the finished product, much like double-checking your ingredients and steps when following a recipe.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?s - sandwich: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?b - bread-portion: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?c - content-portion: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (at_kitchen_bread ?b)\n    (at_kitchen_content ?c)\n    (not_exist ?s)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (at_kitchen_bread ?b))\n    (not (at_kitchen_content ?c))\n    (at_kitchen_sandwich ?s)\n    (not (not_exist ?s))\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

The goal is to move it to another place (say, the dining room, or \"place2\"). The action \"move_tray\" helps us describe this movement step-by-step in a computer program that plans out tasks.\n\nHere\u2019s why the parts of this action make sense:\n1. **Parameters:** The action needs to know three things:\n   - Which tray are we moving? (That's ?t - tray)\n   - Where is the tray right now? (That's ?p1 - place)\n   - Where do we want to move the tray to? (That's ?p2 - place)\n\n2. **Precondition:** Before we can move the tray, we need to make sure it's actually at the starting place (?p1).

This is like saying, \"It\u2019s not in the kitchen anymore.\"\n   - The tray is now at the new place (?p2). This means, \"It\u2019s now in the dining room.\"\n\nThese steps in the action make sure that the computer program understands exactly where the tray is before and after moving it, just like how you would keep track of where you've put something important.\n\nSo, in simple terms, the \"move_tray\" action tells the computer how to move a tray from one place to another in a planned and orderly way, ensuring the tray ends up right where it needs to be for the children to get their sandwiches.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?t - tray: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?p1 - place: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?p2 - place: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(at ?t ?p1)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (at ?t ?p1))\n    (at ?t ?p2)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "user", "content": "Question: Here is the task.\nA natural language description of the domain\nDomain information: Help the hero to get out of dungeon! A hero woke up in a dungeon full of monsters and traps (perhaps the party last night went wrong...) and needs your help to get out.  Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape\n\nA list of available predicates\n1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location\n2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location\n3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster\n4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap\n5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed\n6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells\n7. (arm-free) ;; Hero's hand is free\n8. (holding ?s - swords) ;; Hero's holding a sword\n9. (trap-disarmed ?loc) ;; It becomes true when a trap is disarmed\n\nAction Description: The hero can **move** to an adjacent room (connected by a corridor) that has not been destroyed (i.e., the hero has not already visited the room). When this action is executed, the original cell get destroyed.\n\nAction name: move\n\n\nYour answer:\n", "type": "prompt"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nIn the dungeon domain, the hero needs to navigate through a series of connected rooms, avoiding monsters and traps, to find the exit. The action \"move\" is a fundamental part of this navigation, allowing the hero to progress from one room to another.\n\nFor the hero to move from one room to another, certain conditions must be met:\n\n1. The hero must currently be in a room (this is represented by the `(at-hero ?loc)` predicate).\n2. The room the hero wants to move to must be connected to the hero's current location (this is checked by the `(connected ?from ?to)` predicate).\n3. The room the hero wants to move to must not have been destroyed, ensuring that the hero is not trying to move into a non-existent room (this is inferred by the lack of `(is-destroyed ?to)` predicate).\n\nOnce the hero moves, the following changes occur:\n\n1. The hero is no longer in the original room, which implies that the original room is now destroyed or no longer relevant to the hero's location (this is represented by the `(not (at-hero ?from))` and `(is-destroyed ?from)` effects).\n2. The hero is now in the new room, which is represented by the `(at-hero ?to)` effect.\n\nThe action of moving does not directly interact with monsters, traps, or swords, so these elements do not factor into the preconditions or effects of the \"move\" action itself. However, they may influence other actions in the domain.\n\n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?from - cells: [The cell where the hero is currently located]\n2. ?to - cells: [The cell to which the hero will move]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (at-hero ?from)\n    (connected ?from ?to)\n    (not (is-destroyed ?to))\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (at-hero ?from))\n    (at-hero ?to)\n    (is-destroyed ?from)\n)\n```\n\n---", "type": "response", "action": "move"}
