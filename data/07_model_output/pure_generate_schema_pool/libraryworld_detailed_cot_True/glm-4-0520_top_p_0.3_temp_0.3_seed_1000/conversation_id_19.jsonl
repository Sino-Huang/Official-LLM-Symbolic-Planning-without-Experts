This situation can be broken down into smaller, specific steps to make it easy for a computer to understand and execute. This is where the action schema you mentioned comes into play.\n\nThe action is called \"pick-up,\" and it involves the delivery person picking up newspapers to deliver. This action is defined in a language called PDDL, which is like giving a computer a recipe to follow.\n\n1. **Parameters**: These are like ingredients in a recipe. Here, the ingredients are any newspaper (`?paper`) and a location (`?loc`), which in this scenario is the home base.\n\n2. **Preconditions**: These are conditions that must be true before the action can start. Think of it like checking if you have all your ingredients before you start cooking.\n   - `(at ?loc)`: The delivery person must be at the location specified (`?loc`). This makes sure they are actually at the home base to pick up the newspapers.\n   - `(is_Home_Base ?loc)`: The location where they are must be the home base. This is crucial because newspapers ready to be delivered are stored here.\n   - `(unpacked ?paper)`: The newspapers need to be unpacked and ready to be picked up. It ensures the newspapers are not in boxes or still bundled up, making them easy to grab and go.\n\n3. **Effects**: These describe what happens after the action is completed.\n   - `(not (unpacked ?paper))`: The newspaper is no longer in an unpacked state at the base because it has been picked up.\n   - `(carrying ?paper)`: The newspaper is now being carried by the delivery person, ready to be delivered to someone who needs it.\n\nThis schema helps the computer understand exactly what needs to happen when the \"pick-up\" action is called in the program. By specifying preconditions, we ensure the action makes sense (you can't pick up a newspaper if you're not there or if the papers aren't ready).

This ensures the newspaper is delivered to the correct place.\n   - The delivery location wants a newspaper (`wants_Paper ?loc`): This makes sure that the delivery person is not just going around giving out newspapers to places that don't need them.

The location got what it was waiting for, just like your neighbor feeling happy receiving the letter.\n\nIn summary, the action of delivering a newspaper in this PDDL model ensures that everything needed to complete a successful delivery is in place before the delivery starts, and once done, it updates the state to reflect the successful completion of the task.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you have a small robot hoist that helps move boxes in a big warehouse. The warehouse has different areas, like a spot for loading boxes and another for storing them. The \"go-in\" action is like telling the robot to move from a loading area to a storage area.\n\nNow, why does the robot need certain conditions to be met before it can move? Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **The robot must be at the loading area** (transit_area): This is pretty straightforward. If the robot isn't at the loading area, it can't start moving towards the storage area because it's simply not there to begin the task.\n\n2. **The loading area and storage area must be connected**: It's like making sure there's a clear path or a road between two places before you start driving. If there's no path, the robot can't move between these areas.\n\n3. **The storage area must be clear**: This ensures that there is space available for the robot to enter and place the boxes. It's similar to needing an empty parking spot to park your car.\n\nNow, what happens after the robot moves based on these conditions?\n\n- **The robot is no longer in the loading area**: Just like when you leave your house, you're not inside anymore. The robot has left the loading area, so we say it's no longer there.\n  \n- **The robot is now in the storage area**: Like arriving at a friend\u2019s house after leaving yours, the robot has moved and is now at the storage destination.\n\n- **The storage area is no longer clear**: Since the robot moves in with a box, the space it occupied is now taken. It's like the parking space being occupied once you park your car.\n\nIn summary, these conditions and results make sure the robot moves safely and efficiently from one place to another, without any surprises like arriving at a blocked or non-existent path, or finding no space to drop off the box.

The action we're talking about is called \"drop,\" where the hoist places a crate into a designated storage area.\n\n1. **Preconditions Explained:**\n   - **Connected Areas:** First, the hoist can only drop the crate if the area it\u2019s in (let's call it the play area) is connected to the area where the hoist is currently located (like the shelf area). This means there must be a clear path for the hoist to move the crate to its destination.\n   - **Hoist Location:** The hoist must be in the area adjacent to where the crate needs to go. If our hoist isn't next to the play area, it can't drop the crate there.\n   - **Hoist Lifting the Crate:** Before dropping, the hoist must already be lifting a crate. It's like making sure the hoist has picked up the box of toys before it can put it down.\n   - **Clear Storage Area:** The destination, where the crate will be placed, must be clear of other objects. This ensures there's space to safely place the new crate without stacking or causing a mess.\n   - **Store Area in Place:** The storage area where the crate is to be dropped needs to be part of the larger place being managed. This is like ensuring the play area is actually a part of the designated playroom.\n\n2. **Effects Explained:**\n   - **Hoist No Longer Lifting:** Once the crate is dropped, the hoist is no longer lifting it.

Each turn in the game allows you to move from one house to another. The action of moving from one house to another in the game can be compared to an action in our newspaper delivery model.\n\nIn the scenario, the action is called \"move,\" and it involves a delivery person moving from a starting location to a destination. Let's break down why this action is modeled the way it is:\n\n1. **Parameters**: These are like placeholders or markers in our game. In the \"move\" action, the parameters are the Starting Location and the Destination. It's just like saying, \"I'm starting from my house and going to my friend's house.\"\n\n2. **Preconditions**: Before you can move from one house to another, you must be at the house you're starting from. It wouldn't make sense to say, \"I'm going from my house to my friend's house\" if you're actually at the grocery store, right? So, the precondition that the delivery person is at the starting location is crucial to make the action logical.\n\n3. **Effects**: After you move from your house to your friend's house, you are no longer at your house; you are now at your friend's house. That\u2019s what happens in our model, too. The effect of the move action is that the delivery person is no longer at the starting location and is now at the destination. This change is captured in the model by removing the state of being at the starting location (`not (at ?from)`) and adding the state of being at the destination (`(at ?to)`).\n\nSo, this action schema perfectly represents the simple yet essential task of moving from one point to another, ensuring that the game's rules are followed: you start from where you say you are, and you end up where you want to go.

This ensures that we are moving the right hoist from the correct location.\n\n2. **The destination is clear:** Imagine if the place you wanted to move your train to was already full of other toys. You wouldn\u2019t be able to put your train there, right? Similarly, the schema requires the destination store area to be clear (`clear ?to`) so that the hoist can move there without any issues.\n\n3. **The starting and destination points are connected:** It\u2019s like making sure there\u2019s a clear path or a track between where your train is and where you want it to go. If there\u2019s no track, you can't move the train. In the action schema, this is checked by the condition (`connected ?from ?to`).\n\nNow, when the train (hoist) moves:\n- **It is no longer at the starting point:** Just like when your train leaves one side of the room, it\u2019s not there anymore. This change is shown in the schema by removing the condition that the hoist is at the starting area (`not (at ?h ?from)`).\n  \n- **It is now at the destination:** When you move your train to the other side of the room, it\u2019s now there. This is represented in the schema by adding the condition that the hoist is now at the destination area (`at ?h ?to`).\n\n- **The destination is no longer clear:** Now that the train is at the new spot, that area isn\u2019t empty anymore. This change is reflected by removing the 'clear' condition for the destination area (`not (clear ?to)`).\n\n- **The starting point becomes clear:** Since the train left the starting area, that spot is now free. This is captured by adding a 'clear' condition for the starting area (`clear ?from`).\n\nThis whole process helps ensure that the hoist can safely and efficiently move from one area to another without confusion or conflicts.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?h - hoist: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?c - crate: [short description of the parameter]\n3. ?a1 - store_area: [short description of the parameter]\n4. ?a2 - area: [short description of the parameter]\n5. ?p - place: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (connected ?a1 ?a2)\n    (at ?h ?a2)\n    (available ?h)\n    (on ?c ?a1)\n    (store_area_in ?a1 ?p)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (on ?c ?a1))\n    (clear ?a1)\n    (not (available ?h))\n    (lifting ?h ?c)\n    (not (crate_in ?c ?p))\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you have a small robot hoist that helps move boxes in a big warehouse. The warehouse has different areas, like a spot for loading boxes and another for storing them. The \"go-in\" action is like telling the robot to move from a loading area to a storage area.\n\nNow, why does the robot need certain conditions to be met before it can move? Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **The robot must be at the loading area** (transit_area): This is pretty straightforward. If the robot isn't at the loading area, it can't start moving towards the storage area because it's simply not there to begin the task.\n\n2. **The loading area and storage area must be connected**: It's like making sure there's a clear path or a road between two places before you start driving. If there's no path, the robot can't move between these areas.\n\n3. **The storage area must be clear**: This ensures that there is space available for the robot to enter and place the boxes. It's similar to needing an empty parking spot to park your car.\n\nNow, what happens after the robot moves based on these conditions?\n\n- **The robot is no longer in the loading area**: Just like when you leave your house, you're not inside anymore. The robot has left the loading area, so we say it's no longer there.\n  \n- **The robot is now in the storage area**: Like arriving at a friend\u2019s house after leaving yours, the robot has moved and is now at the storage destination.\n\n- **The storage area is no longer clear**: Since the robot moves in with a box, the space it occupied is now taken. It's like the parking space being occupied once you park your car.\n\nIn summary, these conditions and results make sure the robot moves safely and efficiently from one place to another, without any surprises like arriving at a blocked or non-existent path, or finding no space to drop off the box.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you're playing a game where you need to deliver newspapers to different houses in your neighborhood. Each turn in the game allows you to move from one house to another. The action of moving from one house to another in the game can be compared to an action in our newspaper delivery model.\n\nIn the scenario, the action is called \"move,\" and it involves a delivery person moving from a starting location to a destination. Let's break down why this action is modeled the way it is:\n\n1. **Parameters**: These are like placeholders or markers in our game. In the \"move\" action, the parameters are the Starting Location and the Destination. It's just like saying, \"I'm starting from my house and going to my friend's house.\"\n\n2. **Preconditions**: Before you can move from one house to another, you must be at the house you're starting from. It wouldn't make sense to say, \"I'm going from my house to my friend's house\" if you're actually at the grocery store, right? So, the precondition that the delivery person is at the starting location is crucial to make the action logical.\n\n3. **Effects**: After you move from your house to your friend's house, you are no longer at your house; you are now at your friend's house. That\u2019s what happens in our model, too. The effect of the move action is that the delivery person is no longer at the starting location and is now at the destination. This change is captured in the model by removing the state of being at the starting location (`not (at ?from)`) and adding the state of being at the destination (`(at ?to)`).\n\nSo, this action schema perfectly represents the simple yet essential task of moving from one point to another, ensuring that the game's rules are followed: you start from where you say you are, and you end up where you want to go. It's just like moving pieces on a board game, ensuring each move is valid based on where you are and where you want to be.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?from - loc: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?to - loc: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(at ?from)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (at ?from))\n    (at ?to)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

This is where the action schema you mentioned comes into play.\n\nThe action is called \"pick-up,\" and it involves the delivery person picking up newspapers to deliver. This action is defined in a language called PDDL, which is like giving a computer a recipe to follow.\n\n1. **Parameters**: These are like ingredients in a recipe. Here, the ingredients are any newspaper (`?paper`) and a location (`?loc`), which in this scenario is the home base.\n\n2. **Preconditions**: These are conditions that must be true before the action can start. Think of it like checking if you have all your ingredients before you start cooking.\n   - `(at ?loc)`: The delivery person must be at the location specified (`?loc`). This makes sure they are actually at the home base to pick up the newspapers.\n   - `(is_Home_Base ?loc)`: The location where they are must be the home base. This is crucial because newspapers ready to be delivered are stored here.\n   - `(unpacked ?paper)`: The newspapers need to be unpacked and ready to be picked up.

This means there must be a clear path for the hoist to move the crate to its destination.\n   - **Hoist Location:** The hoist must be in the area adjacent to where the crate needs to go. If our hoist isn't next to the play area, it can't drop the crate there.\n   - **Hoist Lifting the Crate:** Before dropping, the hoist must already be lifting a crate.

This situation can be broken down into smaller, specific steps to make it easy for a computer to understand and execute. This is where the action schema you mentioned comes into play.\n\nThe action is called \"pick-up,\" and it involves the delivery person picking up newspapers to deliver. This action is defined in a language called PDDL, which is like giving a computer a recipe to follow.\n\n1. **Parameters**: These are like ingredients in a recipe. Here, the ingredients are any newspaper (`?paper`) and a location (`?loc`), which in this scenario is the home base.\n\n2. **Preconditions**: These are conditions that must be true before the action can start. Think of it like checking if you have all your ingredients before you start cooking.\n   - `(at ?loc)`: The delivery person must be at the location specified (`?loc`). This makes sure they are actually at the home base to pick up the newspapers.\n   - `(is_Home_Base ?loc)`: The location where they are must be the home base. This is crucial because newspapers ready to be delivered are stored here.\n   - `(unpacked ?paper)`: The newspapers need to be unpacked and ready to be picked up. It ensures the newspapers are not in boxes or still bundled up, making them easy to grab and go.\n\n3. **Effects**: These describe what happens after the action is completed.\n   - `(not (unpacked ?paper))`: The newspaper is no longer in an unpacked state at the base because it has been picked up.\n   - `(carrying ?paper)`: The newspaper is now being carried by the delivery person, ready to be delivered to someone who needs it.\n\nThis schema helps the computer understand exactly what needs to happen when the \"pick-up\" action is called in the program. By specifying preconditions, we ensure the action makes sense (you can't pick up a newspaper if you're not there or if the papers aren't ready). The effects tell the computer how the world changes after the action, like the newspaper moving from being unpacked at the base to being carried for delivery.\n\nBy breaking down tasks this way, we help the computer efficiently and correctly handle tasks that seem simple to us but are quite detailed when programmed.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?from - loc: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?to - loc: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(at ?from)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (at ?from))\n    (at ?to)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you're playing a game where you need to deliver newspapers to different houses in your neighborhood. Each turn in the game allows you to move from one house to another. The action of moving from one house to another in the game can be compared to an action in our newspaper delivery model.\n\nIn the scenario, the action is called \"move,\" and it involves a delivery person moving from a starting location to a destination. Let's break down why this action is modeled the way it is:\n\n1. **Parameters**: These are like placeholders or markers in our game. In the \"move\" action, the parameters are the Starting Location and the Destination. It's just like saying, \"I'm starting from my house and going to my friend's house.\"\n\n2. **Preconditions**: Before you can move from one house to another, you must be at the house you're starting from. It wouldn't make sense to say, \"I'm going from my house to my friend's house\" if you're actually at the grocery store, right? So, the precondition that the delivery person is at the starting location is crucial to make the action logical.\n\n3. **Effects**: After you move from your house to your friend's house, you are no longer at your house; you are now at your friend's house. That\u2019s what happens in our model, too. The effect of the move action is that the delivery person is no longer at the starting location and is now at the destination. This change is captured in the model by removing the state of being at the starting location (`not (at ?from)`) and adding the state of being at the destination (`(at ?to)`).\n\nSo, this action schema perfectly represents the simple yet essential task of moving from one point to another, ensuring that the game's rules are followed: you start from where you say you are, and you end up where you want to go. It's just like moving pieces on a board game, ensuring each move is valid based on where you are and where you want to be.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?paper - paper: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?loc - loc: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (at ?loc)\n    (is_Home_Base ?loc)\n    (unpacked ?paper)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (unpacked ?paper))\n    (carrying ?paper)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you have a small robot hoist that helps move boxes in a big warehouse. The warehouse has different areas, like a spot for loading boxes and another for storing them. The \"go-in\" action is like telling the robot to move from a loading area to a storage area.\n\nNow, why does the robot need certain conditions to be met before it can move? Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **The robot must be at the loading area** (transit_area): This is pretty straightforward. If the robot isn't at the loading area, it can't start moving towards the storage area because it's simply not there to begin the task.\n\n2. **The loading area and storage area must be connected**: It's like making sure there's a clear path or a road between two places before you start driving. If there's no path, the robot can't move between these areas.\n\n3. **The storage area must be clear**: This ensures that there is space available for the robot to enter and place the boxes. It's similar to needing an empty parking spot to park your car.\n\nNow, what happens after the robot moves based on these conditions?\n\n- **The robot is no longer in the loading area**: Just like when you leave your house, you're not inside anymore. The robot has left the loading area, so we say it's no longer there.\n  \n- **The robot is now in the storage area**: Like arriving at a friend\u2019s house after leaving yours, the robot has moved and is now at the storage destination.\n\n- **The storage area is no longer clear**: Since the robot moves in with a box, the space it occupied is now taken. It's like the parking space being occupied once you park your car.\n\nIn summary, these conditions and results make sure the robot moves safely and efficiently from one place to another, without any surprises like arriving at a blocked or non-existent path, or finding no space to drop off the box.

This is necessary because you can't move something from a place it isn't already at.\n   - **Destination area is clear (clear ?to):** This is like making sure that the corner you want to move your toy truck to doesn\u2019t have any obstacles or other toys in the way. The space needs to be clear so the hoist can move in without any issues.\n   - **Areas are connected (connected ?from ?to):** This checks if there is a direct path from the starting point to the destination, similar to making sure there's a clear path on the floor between the two corners of the room for the toy truck to travel without hitting a wall or furniture.\n\n2. **Effects:**\n   - **Hoist moves to the destination (at ?h ?to):** This is like saying your toy truck is now in the new corner of the room.\n   - **Hoist is no longer at the source (not (at ?h ?from)):** Just like your toy truck can't be in two places at once, when the hoist moves to the new area, it's no longer in the original area.\n   - **Destination area is no longer clear (not (clear ?to)):** Now that the hoist (or your toy truck) is in the new corner, that corner isn't empty anymore.\n   - **Source area becomes clear (clear ?from):** Since the hoist has moved away from the original area, that area is now free of obstacles or the hoist itself.\n\nSo, in simple terms, this action is like moving a toy from one clear, connected corner of the room to another.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine you want to move a toy train (representing the hoist) from one side of your playroom (a store area) to another. Before moving it, you need to make sure of a few things:\n\n1. **The train is actually at the starting point:** Just like you need to know where your train is before you can move it, the action schema checks if the hoist is at the starting store area (`at ?h ?from`). This ensures that we are moving the right hoist from the correct location.\n\n2. **The destination is clear:** Imagine if the place you wanted to move your train to was already full of other toys. You wouldn\u2019t be able to put your train there, right? Similarly, the schema requires the destination store area to be clear (`clear ?to`) so that the hoist can move there without any issues.\n\n3. **The starting and destination points are connected:** It\u2019s like making sure there\u2019s a clear path or a track between where your train is and where you want it to go. If there\u2019s no track, you can't move the train. In the action schema, this is checked by the condition (`connected ?from ?to`).\n\nNow, when the train (hoist) moves:\n- **It is no longer at the starting point:** Just like when your train leaves one side of the room, it\u2019s not there anymore. This change is shown in the schema by removing the condition that the hoist is at the starting area (`not (at ?h ?from)`).\n  \n- **It is now at the destination:** When you move your train to the other side of the room, it\u2019s now there.

The \"go-in\" action is like telling the robot to move from a loading area to a storage area.\n\nNow, why does the robot need certain conditions to be met before it can move? Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **The robot must be at the loading area** (transit_area): This is pretty straightforward. If the robot isn't at the loading area, it can't start moving towards the storage area because it's simply not there to begin the task.\n\n2. **The loading area and storage area must be connected**: It's like making sure there's a clear path or a road between two places before you start driving. If there's no path, the robot can't move between these areas.\n\n3. **The storage area must be clear**: This ensures that there is space available for the robot to enter and place the boxes. It's similar to needing an empty parking spot to park your car.\n\nNow, what happens after the robot moves based on these conditions?\n\n- **The robot is no longer in the loading area**: Just like when you leave your house, you're not inside anymore. The robot has left the loading area, so we say it's no longer there.\n  \n- **The robot is now in the storage area**: Like arriving at a friend\u2019s house after leaving yours, the robot has moved and is now at the storage destination.\n\n- **The storage area is no longer clear**: Since the robot moves in with a box, the space it occupied is now taken. It's like the parking space being occupied once you park your car.\n\nIn summary, these conditions and results make sure the robot moves safely and efficiently from one place to another, without any surprises like arriving at a blocked or non-existent path, or finding no space to drop off the box.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you're playing a game where you need to deliver newspapers to different houses in your neighborhood. Each turn in the game allows you to move from one house to another. The action of moving from one house to another in the game can be compared to an action in our newspaper delivery model.\n\nIn the scenario, the action is called \"move,\" and it involves a delivery person moving from a starting location to a destination. Let's break down why this action is modeled the way it is:\n\n1. **Parameters**: These are like placeholders or markers in our game. In the \"move\" action, the parameters are the Starting Location and the Destination. It's just like saying, \"I'm starting from my house and going to my friend's house.\"\n\n2. **Preconditions**: Before you can move from one house to another, you must be at the house you're starting from. It wouldn't make sense to say, \"I'm going from my house to my friend's house\" if you're actually at the grocery store, right? So, the precondition that the delivery person is at the starting location is crucial to make the action logical.\n\n3. **Effects**: After you move from your house to your friend's house, you are no longer at your house; you are now at your friend's house. That\u2019s what happens in our model, too. The effect of the move action is that the delivery person is no longer at the starting location and is now at the destination. This change is captured in the model by removing the state of being at the starting location (`not (at ?from)`) and adding the state of being at the destination (`(at ?to)`).\n\nSo, this action schema perfectly represents the simple yet essential task of moving from one point to another, ensuring that the game's rules are followed: you start from where you say you are, and you end up where you want to go. It's just like moving pieces on a board game, ensuring each move is valid based on where you are and where you want to be.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?from - loc: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?to - loc: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(at ?from)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (at ?from))\n    (at ?to)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}

This situation can be broken down into smaller, specific steps to make it easy for a computer to understand and execute. This is where the action schema you mentioned comes into play.\n\nThe action is called \"pick-up,\" and it involves the delivery person picking up newspapers to deliver. This action is defined in a language called PDDL, which is like giving a computer a recipe to follow.\n\n1. **Parameters**: These are like ingredients in a recipe. Here, the ingredients are any newspaper (`?paper`) and a location (`?loc`), which in this scenario is the home base.\n\n2. **Preconditions**: These are conditions that must be true before the action can start. Think of it like checking if you have all your ingredients before you start cooking.\n   - `(at ?loc)`: The delivery person must be at the location specified (`?loc`). This makes sure they are actually at the home base to pick up the newspapers.\n   - `(is_Home_Base ?loc)`: The location where they are must be the home base. This is crucial because newspapers ready to be delivered are stored here.\n   - `(unpacked ?paper)`: The newspapers need to be unpacked and ready to be picked up.

By specifying preconditions, we ensure the action makes sense (you can't pick up a newspaper if you're not there or if the papers aren't ready). The effects tell the computer how the world changes after the action, like the newspaper moving from being unpacked at the base to being carried for delivery.\n\nBy breaking down tasks this way, we help the computer efficiently and correctly handle tasks that seem simple to us but are quite detailed when programmed.\n                \n**Response:**\nParameters:\n1. ?paper - paper: [short description of the parameter]\n2. ?loc - loc: [short description of the parameter]\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (at ?loc)\n    (is_Home_Base ?loc)\n    (unpacked ?paper)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (unpacked ?paper))\n    (carrying ?paper)\n)\n```\n\n---\n", "type": "prompt"}
