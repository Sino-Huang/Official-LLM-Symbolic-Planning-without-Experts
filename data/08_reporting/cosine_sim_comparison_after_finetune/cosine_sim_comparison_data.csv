A natural language description of the domain
Domain information: Help the hero to get out of dungeon! A hero woke up in a dungeon full of monsters and traps (perhaps the party last night went wrong...) and needs your help to get out.  Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape

A list of available predicates
1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location
2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location
3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster
4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap
5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed
6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells
7. (arm-free) ;; Hero's hand is free
8. (holding ?s - swords) ;; Hero's holding a sword
9. (trap-disarmed ?loc) ;; It becomes true when a trap is disarmed

Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape

A list of available predicates
1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location
2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location
3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster
4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap
5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed
6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells
7. (arm-free) ;; Hero's hand is free
8. (holding ?s - swords) ;; Hero's holding a sword
9. (trap-disarmed ?loc) ;; It becomes true when a trap is disarmed

A natural language description of the domain
Domain information: Help the hero to get out of dungeon! A hero woke up in a dungeon full of monsters and traps (perhaps the party last night went wrong...) and needs your help to get out.  Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape

A list of available predicates
1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location
2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location
3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster
4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap
5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed
6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells
7. (arm-free) ;; Hero's hand is free
8. (holding ?s - swords) ;; Hero's holding a sword
9. (trap-disarmed ?loc) ;; It becomes true when a trap is disarmed

Action Description: The hero can **move** to an adjacent room (connected by a corridor) that has not been destroyed (i.e., the hero has not already visited the room). When this action is executed, the original cell get destroyed.

A natural language description of the domain
Domain information: Help the hero to get out of dungeon! A hero woke up in a dungeon full of monsters and traps (perhaps the party last night went wrong...) and needs your help to get out.  Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape

A list of available predicates
1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location
2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location
3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster
4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap
5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed
6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells
7. (arm-free) ;; Hero's hand is free
8. (holding ?s - swords) ;; Hero's holding a sword
9. (trap-disarmed ?loc) ;; It becomes true when a trap is disarmed

Action Description: The hero can **move** to an adjacent room (connected by a corridor) that has not been destroyed (i.e., the hero has not already visited the room). When this action is executed, the hero gets into a location with a monster

A natural language description of the domain
Domain information: Help the hero to get out of dungeon! A hero woke up in a dungeon full of monsters and traps (perhaps the party last night went wrong...) and needs your help to get out.  Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape

A list of available predicates
1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location
2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location
3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster
4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap
5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed
6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells
7. (arm-free) ;; Hero's hand is free
8. (holding ?s - swords) ;; Hero's holding a sword
9. (trap-disarmed ?loc) ;; It becomes true when a trap is disarmed

Action Description: **Destroy** the sword that the hero currently holds. However, this can have unpleasant effects if done in a room with a trap or a monster: it triggers the trap or invites the monster to eat the hero.

A natural language description of the domain
Domain information: Help the hero to get out of dungeon! A hero woke up in a dungeon full of monsters and traps (perhaps the party last night went wrong...) and needs your help to get out.  Here are basic facts for the dungeon domain: - The dungeon contains rooms that are **connected** by corridors (dungeon can thus be represented by undirected graph) - each room can be **empty**, or can have a **monster** in it, or can have a **trap** in it, or can have a **sword** in it - one of the empty rooms is the **goal**: it has an exit, so the hero can escape

A list of available predicates
1. (at-hero ?loc - cells) ;;  Hero's cell location
2. (at-sword ?s - swords ?loc - cells) ;; Sword cell location
3. (has-monster ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a monster
4. (has-trap ?loc - cells) ;; Indicates if a cell location has a trap
5. (is-destroyed ?obj) ;; Indicates if a chell or sword has been destroyed
6. (connected ?from ?to - cells) ;; connects cells
7. (arm-free) ;; Hero's hand is free
8. (holding ?s - swords) ;; Hero's holding a sword
9. (trap-disarmed ?loc) ;; It becomes true when a trap is disarmed

Action Description: **Destroy** the sword that the hero currently holds. However, this can have unpleasant effects if done in a room with a trap or a monster: it triggers the trap or invites the monster to eat the hero.

That's what the recall action does. It's like saying, 'Okay, I'm done with this axe; let's magically put it back in my backpack.' This action not only puts the item away but also ensures that the agent's hands are now empty and ready for something else.

Domain information: Moving and storing crates of goods by hoists from containers to depots with spatial maps. This domain deals with the movement and storage of crates of goods using hoists. It involves different locations like containers and depots, and requires managing the spatial arrangement of crates and hoists in various areas. The actions primarily focus on the lifting, moving, and placement of crates by hoists, considering the spatial and availability constraints of the areas involved.

A list of available predicates
1. (clear ?s - store_area) ;; the store area is clear
2. (crate_in ?c - crate ?p - place) ;; the crate is in the place
3. (store_area_in ?s - store_area ?p - place) ;; the store area is in the place
4. (available ?h - hoist) ;; the hoist is available
5. (lifting ?h - hoist ?c - crate) ;; the hoist is lifting the crate
6. (at ?h - hoist ?a - area) ;; the hoist is at the area
7. (on ?c - crate ?s - store_area) ;; the crate is on the store area
8. (connected ?a1 ?a2 - area) ;; the area a1 is connected to the area a2

Action Description: This is the reverse of Go-out, where a hoist moves from a transit_area to a store_area. Preconditions include the hoist being at the transit_area, the areas being connected, and the destination store_area being clear. The effect is similar to Go-out but in reverse.

Ensure that only the provided predicates are used to construct the preconditions and effects.
Question: Here is the task.
A natural language description of the domain
Domain information: This describes a cooking or baking process where ingredients such as eggs and flour are used. The process of baking involves putting eggs in the pan followed by the flour, mix the two and then put the pan in the oven and then remove the pan from the oven to get the baked cake. Lastly, the pan is cleaned using a soap. Well, you can also bake a souffle but in at bit different process.
