Problem Init State Desc:
In the Minecraft world, there are several moveable objects: grass-0, grass-1, log-2, new-0, new-1, and new-2. The agent is positioned at location loc-0-2 and currently has free hands. The hypothetical objects new-0, new-1, and new-2 exist but are not yet tangible in the environment. Grass-0 is located at loc-2-2, grass-1 is at loc-0-0, and log-2 is at loc-3-0. The agent can interact with these objects and move between various static locations, which include loc-0-0 through loc-3-3.

Problem Goal State Desc:
The objective is for the agent to be positioned at location loc-1-1 and to have grass-1 in its inventory.
