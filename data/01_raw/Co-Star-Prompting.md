# CO-STAR framework 
The CO-STAR framework is a structured template for crafting effective prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). Developed by GovTech Singapore's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division, CO-STAR is designed to improve the quality of LLM-generated responses by systematically addressing key aspects that influence output.

## What is CO-STAR?
The CO-STAR acronym stands for:

1. Context (C): Provide background information on the task.
2. Objective (O): Define the specific task you want the LLM to perform.
3. Style (S): Specify the desired writing style for the LLM's response.
4. Tone (T): Set the attitude or emotional quality of the response.
5. Audience (A): Identify the intended recipients of the response.
6. Response (R): Outline the expected format of the response.

## Example
```python
prompt_template = """
