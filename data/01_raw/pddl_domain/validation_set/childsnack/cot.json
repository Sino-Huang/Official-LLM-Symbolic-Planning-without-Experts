    "serve_sandwich_no_gluten": "**Explanation:**\nImagine you're at a fun picnic where some kids need special gluten-free sandwiches because they're allergic to gluten. In our plan, there's a special task called `serve_sandwich_no_gluten`, which is like a set of instructions to make sure these kids get the right sandwich safely and happily.\n\n1. **Understanding the Ingredients and the Setting**:\n   - **Child and Place**: First, we need a child who is allergic to gluten and waiting at a specific place.\n   - **Sandwich and Tray**: We also need a sandwich that is gluten-free and placed on a tray.\n   - **Tray's Location**: The tray with the sandwich needs to be at the same place where the child is waiting.\n\n2. **Action Steps (Preconditions)**:\n   - The child must be allergic to gluten (`allergic_gluten ?c`). This tells us to be extra careful with this child's food.\n   - The gluten-free sandwich should be on the tray (`ontray ?s ?t`), ready to be served.\n   - The child should be waiting at a specific spot (`waiting ?c ?p`), ready to receive their sandwich.\n   - The sandwich needs to be gluten-free (`no_gluten_sandwich ?s`), so it's safe for the child.\n   - The tray with the sandwich has to be at the same place as the waiting child (`at ?t ?p`), so it's easy to serve.\n\n3. **What Happens After the Action (Effects)**:\n   - The sandwich is taken off the tray (`not (ontray ?s ?t)`), because it's being given to the child.\n   - The child is considered served (`served ?c`), meaning they've happily received their sandwich and can start enjoying their meal.\n\nIn simple terms, this action ensures that a child who cannot eat gluten gets a safe, gluten-free sandwich right where they're waiting, and then we mark that they've been served. It's all about making sure everyone at the picnic has a good time with the right food for them!",
    "make_sandwich": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you're in a kitchen, ready to make a sandwich. You need two main things to start: a portion of bread and some filling, which we'll call the content. In the domain we're talking about, the task is to make sandwiches, ensuring that all the bread and content are there before you begin. This setup helps in organizing how sandwiches are made and ensures that ingredients are used properly.\n\nIn the action named `make_sandwich`, the goal is to create a sandwich using these ingredients. Let's break down the action into steps, much like following a recipe:\n\n1. **Parameters:** These are like the ingredients listed at the start of a recipe. For this action, the ingredients (parameters) are a sandwich (`?s`), a bread portion (`?b`), and a content portion (`?c`).\n\n2. **Preconditions:** Before you can make a sandwich, you need to make sure you have everything you need. In this case, the preconditions are that:\n   - The bread portion (`?b`) is available in the kitchen. This is checked with `(at_kitchen_bread ?b)`.\n   - The content portion (`?c`) is also available in the kitchen, checked by `(at_kitchen_content ?c)`.\n   - The sandwich you're going to make (`?s`) doesn't already exist. This prevents making duplicate sandwiches and is checked by `(not_exist ?s)`.\n\n3. **Effects:** After making the sandwich, the action results in changes, like steps in a recipe telling you what to do next:\n   - The bread portion (`?b`) used is no longer available in the kitchen. This is noted by `(not (at_kitchen_bread ?b))`, meaning the bread is now part of the sandwich.\n   - Similarly, the content (`?c`) is used up and thus not available as a separate item, noted by `(not (at_kitchen_content ?c))`.\n   - A new sandwich (`?s`) is now available in the kitchen, checked by `(at_kitchen_sandwich ?s)`.\n   - Since the sandwich is made, it now exists, changing the state from `(not_exist ?s)` to its negation, indicating the sandwich's presence.\n\nThrough these steps, the action of making a sandwich is clearly defined from start to finish, ensuring that all necessary ingredients are used appropriately and result in a final product\u2014a sandwich ready to be served!\n\nThis methodical approach ensures everything is in order before starting and reflects accurately in the finished product, much like double-checking your ingredients and steps when following a recipe.",
    "put_on_tray": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine you're helping out in a kitchen where you're preparing sandwiches for a party. Now, one of your tasks is to move a sandwich from the kitchen counter (where it was made) to a serving tray that's also in the kitchen. This simple task in real life is what the action \"put_on_tray\" represents in our planning domain.\n\nIn this specific scenario, we have two main things to check before you can put the sandwich on the tray:\n1. **The sandwich must be in the kitchen.** This is pretty straightforward, right? You need to know where the sandwich is to be able to pick it up and move it. In the domain model, this is captured by the condition `(at_kitchen_sandwich ?s)`. It just means, \"Check if the sandwich is at the kitchen.\"\n   \n2. **The tray must be in the kitchen.** Similarly, you need the tray to be in the kitchen as well. You can't put a sandwich on a tray that's not there! This condition is written as `(at ?t kitchen)` in the model. It's a way of saying, \"Make sure that the tray is at the kitchen.\"\n\nNow, once you've confirmed both conditions\u2014sandwich is in the kitchen and so is the tray\u2014you can go ahead and place the sandwich on the tray. What happens then? In the real world, the sandwich is no longer just 'sitting in the kitchen'; it's now on the tray. In the domain model, this change is described by the effects of the action:\n- **The sandwich is no longer just in the kitchen.** This is represented by `(not (at_kitchen_sandwich ?s))`. It means, \"The sandwich is no longer at the kitchen counter.\"\n- **The sandwich is now on the tray.** This is shown by `(ontray ?s ?t)`. It simply says, \"Now, the sandwich is on the tray.\"\n\nBy modeling it this way, the planning system understands exactly what conditions need to be true to perform the action (moving a sandwich onto a tray), and what changes happen after the action is taken. This helps in planning out all the steps needed to prepare and serve sandwiches efficiently, especially in a scenario where you might need to consider dietary restrictions like gluten allergies.\n\nSo, in summary, the action \"put_on_tray\" checks if both the sandwich and the tray are in the kitchen, and then updates their status to reflect that the sandwich has been moved onto the tray. This is crucial for ensuring that everything is ready and in the right place for the next steps, like serving the sandwiches to the children.",
    "make_sandwich_no_gluten": "**Explanation:**\n\nThink of making a gluten-free sandwich as following a special recipe that makes sure it's safe for kids allergic to gluten.\n\n**1. Check Ingredients:** First, we ensure the gluten-free bread and other ingredients are in the kitchen. This is like making sure you have all your cooking supplies ready.\n\n**2. Ensure Safety:** We check that the bread and ingredients are gluten-free to protect the children from allergies.\n\n**3. Sandwich Creation:** We then use these ingredients to make the sandwich. Once the sandwich is made, the individual bread and contents are no longer just lying around\u2014they're part of the sandwich now.\n\n**4. Update Kitchen:** After making it, we add the sandwich to the list of items in the kitchen and confirm it's gluten-free.\n\n**5. Recognize Existence:** Finally, we acknowledge that the sandwich now exists in the kitchen ready to be served.\n\nEach step in this \"recipe\" helps us carefully prepare a sandwich that's safe for everyone, especially those with gluten allergies.",
    "move_tray": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you have a tray of sandwiches in the kitchen, and you need to move it to the dining room where the children are waiting to eat. This situation in real life is similar to what the action \"move_tray\" does in the planning domain for making and serving sandwiches.\n\nIn this action, the tray starts in one place (let's call this the kitchen, or \"place1\"). The goal is to move it to another place (say, the dining room, or \"place2\"). The action \"move_tray\" helps us describe this movement step-by-step in a computer program that plans out tasks.\n\nHere\u2019s why the parts of this action make sense:\n1. **Parameters:** The action needs to know three things:\n   - Which tray are we moving? (That's ?t - tray)\n   - Where is the tray right now? (That's ?p1 - place)\n   - Where do we want to move the tray to? (That's ?p2 - place)\n\n2. **Precondition:** Before we can move the tray, we need to make sure it's actually at the starting place (?p1). This is like checking to see if the tray is really in the kitchen before we try to take it to the dining room.\n\n3. **Effect:** After moving the tray, two things happen:\n   - The tray is no longer at the starting place (?p1). This is like saying, \"It\u2019s not in the kitchen anymore.\"\n   - The tray is now at the new place (?p2). This means, \"It\u2019s now in the dining room.\"\n\nThese steps in the action make sure that the computer program understands exactly where the tray is before and after moving it, just like how you would keep track of where you've put something important.\n\nSo, in simple terms, the \"move_tray\" action tells the computer how to move a tray from one place to another in a planned and orderly way, ensuring the tray ends up right where it needs to be for the children to get their sandwiches.",
    "serve_sandwich": "**Explanation:**\nThe action schema you've described, \"serve_sandwich,\" is designed to model the process of serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten at a specific location, while also ensuring the sandwich is removed from the tray after serving. Let's break it down into simpler parts to understand how this works.\n\n1. **Parameters of the Action:**\n   - The action involves four main elements: a sandwich (`?s`), a child (`?c`), a tray (`?t`), and a place (`?p`). These elements are necessary to specify who gets the sandwich, where they get it, and how the sandwich is served.\n\n2. **Preconditions of the Action:**\n   - **Child is not allergic to gluten (`not_allergic_gluten ?c`):** Before serving the sandwich, it's crucial to make sure that the child does not have a gluten allergy. This avoids any health issues.\n   - **Child is waiting (`waiting ?c ?p`):** The child must be waiting at a specific place. This condition ensures that the child is ready to receive the sandwich.\n   - **Sandwich is on the tray (`ontray ?s ?t`):** This checks that the sandwich is available on the tray, indicating it's prepared and ready to be served.\n   - **Tray is at the same place as the child (`at ?t ?p`):** The tray with the sandwich must be in the same location as the waiting child to ensure that the sandwich can be handed over directly.\n\n3. **Effects of the Action:**\n   - **Removing the sandwich from the tray (`not (ontray ?s ?t)`):** Once the sandwich is served, this effect updates the situation by noting that the sandwich is no longer on the tray.\n   - **Child is served (`served ?c`):** This records that the child has now been served the sandwich, fulfilling part of the goal in the sandwich serving scenario.\n\nOverall, this action schema helps coordinate the task of serving sandwiches safely and efficiently, taking into account the location of the child and their dietary restrictions. It ensures that each step is validated before the sandwich is served, and it records the change in the situation once the action is completed. This systematic approach helps in planning and executing tasks without errors, especially in scenarios involving food safety and children's health."
