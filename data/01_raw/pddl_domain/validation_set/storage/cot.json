    "lift": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine you want to move a toy train (representing the hoist) from one side of your playroom (a store area) to another. Before moving it, you need to make sure of a few things:\n\n1. **The train is actually at the starting point:** Just like you need to know where your train is before you can move it, the action schema checks if the hoist is at the starting store area (`at ?h ?from`). This ensures that we are moving the right hoist from the correct location.\n\n2. **The destination is clear:** Imagine if the place you wanted to move your train to was already full of other toys. You wouldn\u2019t be able to put your train there, right? Similarly, the schema requires the destination store area to be clear (`clear ?to`) so that the hoist can move there without any issues.\n\n3. **The starting and destination points are connected:** It\u2019s like making sure there\u2019s a clear path or a track between where your train is and where you want it to go. If there\u2019s no track, you can't move the train. In the action schema, this is checked by the condition (`connected ?from ?to`).\n\nNow, when the train (hoist) moves:\n- **It is no longer at the starting point:** Just like when your train leaves one side of the room, it\u2019s not there anymore. This change is shown in the schema by removing the condition that the hoist is at the starting area (`not (at ?h ?from)`).\n  \n- **It is now at the destination:** When you move your train to the other side of the room, it\u2019s now there. This is represented in the schema by adding the condition that the hoist is now at the destination area (`at ?h ?to`).\n\n- **The destination is no longer clear:** Now that the train is at the new spot, that area isn\u2019t empty anymore. This change is reflected by removing the 'clear' condition for the destination area (`not (clear ?to)`).\n\n- **The starting point becomes clear:** Since the train left the starting area, that spot is now free. This is captured by adding a 'clear' condition for the starting area (`clear ?from`).\n\nThis whole process helps ensure that the hoist can safely and efficiently move from one area to another without confusion or conflicts.",
    "go-in": "**Explanation:**\n\nImagine you have a small robot hoist that helps move boxes in a big warehouse. The warehouse has different areas, like a spot for loading boxes and another for storing them. The \"go-in\" action is like telling the robot to move from a loading area to a storage area.\n\nNow, why does the robot need certain conditions to be met before it can move? Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **The robot must be at the loading area** (transit_area): This is pretty straightforward. If the robot isn't at the loading area, it can't start moving towards the storage area because it's simply not there to begin the task.\n\n2. **The loading area and storage area must be connected**: It's like making sure there's a clear path or a road between two places before you start driving. If there's no path, the robot can't move between these areas.\n\n3. **The storage area must be clear**: This ensures that there is space available for the robot to enter and place the boxes. It's similar to needing an empty parking spot to park your car.\n\nNow, what happens after the robot moves based on these conditions?\n\n- **The robot is no longer in the loading area**: Just like when you leave your house, you're not inside anymore. The robot has left the loading area, so we say it's no longer there.\n  \n- **The robot is now in the storage area**: Like arriving at a friend\u2019s house after leaving yours, the robot has moved and is now at the storage destination.\n\n- **The storage area is no longer clear**: Since the robot moves in with a box, the space it occupied is now taken. It's like the parking space being occupied once you park your car.\n\nIn summary, these conditions and results make sure the robot moves safely and efficiently from one place to another, without any surprises like arriving at a blocked or non-existent path, or finding no space to drop off the box. This careful planning helps keep everything in the warehouse running smoothly!",
    "move": "**Explanation:**\n\nLet's imagine a scenario where you need to move a toy truck from one corner of a room to another. This toy truck represents the hoist, and the corners of the room are like different storage areas in our description.\n\n1. **Preconditions:**\n   - **Hoist is at the source area (at ?h ?from):** This condition makes sure that the hoist is actually at the starting point (like making sure your toy truck is really in the corner where you want to start moving it from). This is necessary because you can't move something from a place it isn't already at.\n   - **Destination area is clear (clear ?to):** This is like making sure that the corner you want to move your toy truck to doesn\u2019t have any obstacles or other toys in the way. The space needs to be clear so the hoist can move in without any issues.\n   - **Areas are connected (connected ?from ?to):** This checks if there is a direct path from the starting point to the destination, similar to making sure there's a clear path on the floor between the two corners of the room for the toy truck to travel without hitting a wall or furniture.\n\n2. **Effects:**\n   - **Hoist moves to the destination (at ?h ?to):** This is like saying your toy truck is now in the new corner of the room.\n   - **Hoist is no longer at the source (not (at ?h ?from)):** Just like your toy truck can't be in two places at once, when the hoist moves to the new area, it's no longer in the original area.\n   - **Destination area is no longer clear (not (clear ?to)):** Now that the hoist (or your toy truck) is in the new corner, that corner isn't empty anymore.\n   - **Source area becomes clear (clear ?from):** Since the hoist has moved away from the original area, that area is now free of obstacles or the hoist itself.\n\nSo, in simple terms, this action is like moving a toy from one clear, connected corner of the room to another. Before you move it, you need to check that it\u2019s starting in the right place, that there\u2019s no blockage where it\u2019s going, and that it can directly reach there. Once moved, the toy truck\u2019s old spot becomes empty, and its new spot is now occupied by it.",
    "go-out": "**Explanation:** Let's imagine we have a little robotic hoist in a big warehouse. Its job is to move from one specific area where it usually stores things, called a store area, to another area meant for transitioning goods, which we call a transit area. Now, this action of moving from the store area to the transit area is called \"go-out.\"\n\nTo make sure this action goes smoothly, there are a few things that need to be in place beforehand, which we call preconditions. First, our little hoist needs to be at the store area to start with\u2014if it\u2019s somewhere else, it can\u2019t start moving from the store area, right? That's like saying you need to be at home to start walking to the park. Secondly, the store area and the transit area need to be connected. If there's no path or door between them, our hoist can't get to the transit area. It's a bit like needing a road or a path to walk on.\n\nNow, when the hoist successfully moves to the transit area, we have some changes that occur, which are the effects of the action. The hoist is no longer in the store area (it has moved, after all), and it's now in the transit area. This is straightforward: the hoist was here, and now it\u2019s there. Additionally, the store area becomes 'clear' or empty because the hoist has moved out. This is like saying that once you leave your room, the room is empty.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"go-out\" action moves our hoist from one area to another and makes sure the starting area is free for other activities. This helps keep things organized and running smoothly in our warehouse scenario.",
    "drop": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine a scenario in a warehouse where a hoist is used to move crates from one area to another, like moving a box of toys from a shelf to a play area. The action we're talking about is called \"drop,\" where the hoist places a crate into a designated storage area.\n\n1. **Preconditions Explained:**\n   - **Connected Areas:** First, the hoist can only drop the crate if the area it\u2019s in (let's call it the play area) is connected to the area where the hoist is currently located (like the shelf area). This means there must be a clear path for the hoist to move the crate to its destination.\n   - **Hoist Location:** The hoist must be in the area adjacent to where the crate needs to go. If our hoist isn't next to the play area, it can't drop the crate there.\n   - **Hoist Lifting the Crate:** Before dropping, the hoist must already be lifting a crate. It's like making sure the hoist has picked up the box of toys before it can put it down.\n   - **Clear Storage Area:** The destination, where the crate will be placed, must be clear of other objects. This ensures there's space to safely place the new crate without stacking or causing a mess.\n   - **Store Area in Place:** The storage area where the crate is to be dropped needs to be part of the larger place being managed. This is like ensuring the play area is actually a part of the designated playroom.\n\n2. **Effects Explained:**\n   - **Hoist No Longer Lifting:** Once the crate is dropped, the hoist is no longer lifting it. This is like putting down the box of toys.\n   - **Hoist Becomes Available:** After dropping off the crate, the hoist is now free to take on other tasks, like picking up another box.\n   - **Storage Area Not Clear Anymore:** Since the crate has been placed there, the storage area is no longer empty.\n   - **Crate on Storage Area:** The crate is now officially in the storage area, like the box of toys now being in the play area.\n   - **Crate Location Updated:** We update the records to show that the crate is now in this new location within the place, which helps in managing space and knowing where everything is.\n\nThis action of dropping a crate involves several steps and conditions that ensure everything happens smoothly and safely, from ensuring there's a path to the hoist being ready and the space being available for the new crate. It's like making sure you have both hands free and a clear spot on the floor before you set down a heavy box."
