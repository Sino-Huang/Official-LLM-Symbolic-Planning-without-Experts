    "move_to": "**Explanation:**\nImagine you're playing a game where you need to explore different rooms by finding keys that unlock them, much like a treasure hunt. The action called \"pick\" in this game allows you to pick up a key from a specific location so you can unlock a room.\n\nHere\u2019s why the action schema matches your description:\n1. **Parameters**: You have parameters like `?loc` (where the key is found), `?key` (the key you find), and `?room` (the room that the key opens). These parameters help define what the action involves\u2014picking up a key at a location that unlocks a specific room.\n\n2. **Preconditions**:\n   - `(at ?loc)`: This means that you, the player, must be at the same location as the key. It ensures you are in the right place to pick it up, like being in the hallway where the key is on the table.\n   - `(key_at ?key ?loc)`: This ensures that the key you need is indeed at your location. It checks that the key is actually there before you can pick it up.\n   - `(key_for_room ?key ?room)`: This confirms that the key you are about to pick up is the correct one for unlocking the specific room you want to enter, like the attic.\n\n3. **Effects**:\n   - `(not (key_at ?key ?loc))`: Once you pick up the key, it's no longer lying there at the location. This effect updates the game state to show the key has been moved\u2014it's now with you.\n   - `(unlocked ?room)`: The action of picking up the key leads to the room being unlocked. Now, you can enter the room you wanted, such as the attic, which was previously locked.\n\nBy combining these elements, the action of \"pick\" logically lets you find a key and use it to access new areas in the game, opening up more adventures\u2014just like in the story of finding a key to unlock the attic.",
    "pick": "**Explanation:**\nImagine you're playing a game where you're exploring different rooms and finding keys that can unlock new areas. The action called \"pick\" in this game lets you pick up a key that's in the same location as you, which then unlocks a room that the key is meant for. Let's break down how this works in simple terms.\n\nFirst, you need to be in the same location as the key. That's like being in a hallway where you see a key on a table. The action requires that you are right there with the key, which makes sense, right? You can't pick up a key from another room!\n\nNext, the key you find has to be the right one for a specific room. It\u2019s like having a label on the key saying \"this key is for the attic,\" ensuring that you don't try to use a kitchen key to open the attic.\n\nNow, when you pick up the key, the game checks two important things before letting you pick it up:\n1. **You are at the key's location**: You have to be right there where the key is.\n2. **The key is for the room you want to unlock**: This makes sure the key matches the room you\u2019re trying to access.\n\nOnce these conditions are met, and you pick up the key, two things happen:\n1. **The key is no longer at its original location**: Just like in real life, once you pick something up, it's not there anymore.\n2. **The room unlocks**: It\u2019s like the key told the door, \"Hey, open up!\" and now you can go into the attic and explore.\n\nThis action, \"pick,\" neatly connects your action of picking up the key with the effect of unlocking a new room, making the game or the story you're in feel real and connected. The conditions you meet before picking up the key ensure that everything makes sense and flows logically, just like in real life when you need the right key to open a specific door."
