    "recall": "**Explanation:** Let's imagine you're playing a game similar to Minecraft. In this game, you have an action called \"recall,\" which lets you move an item you are holding directly into your backpack, making your hands empty again. To understand how this action works in the game's programming language (PDDL), let's break down the requirements and results of this action step-by-step.\n\n1. **Precondition (What needs to be true before the action?):** \n   The precondition for the \"recall\" action is `(equipped ?var0 ?var1)`. This simply means that the item (`?var0`) must be currently held (equipped) by the player (`?var1`). Think of it as checking if you really have the axe in your hand before you can put it away.\n\n2. **Effect (What happens after the action is done?):** \n   The effects of this action are several:\n   - `(inventory ?var0)`: The item you were holding is now in your inventory. This is like saying, \"Okay, the axe is now in my backpack.\"\n   - `(not (equipped ?var0 ?var1))`: You are no longer holding the item. This ensures that the game knows the axe is no longer in your hand.\n   - `(handsfree ?var1)`: Your hands are now empty. This part is like confirming that your hands are free, ready to grab or use something else.\n\nBy setting these preconditions and effects, the game ensures that the action of recalling an item (like teleporting your axe to your backpack) is logical and consistent with the game's rules. You need to be holding the item first to store it away, and after storing it, your hands should indeed be empty, ready for the next task. This keeps the game from getting confused, like trying to put away an axe you aren\u2019t holding or ending up with an axe still in your hand after you've tried to store it.\n\nIn summary, the \"recall\" action in the game ensures everything happens in an orderly and expected manner, making your gameplay experience smooth and realistic within the game's world.",
    "move": "**Explanation:**\nLet's think about the action called \"move\" in a Minecraft-like game, where the goal is to get an agent (like a player) from one place to another. The PDDL action schema you're asking about is designed to handle this simple yet crucial task.\n\nIn the action schema, we have two parameters: `?var0` and `?var1`, which are both locations. You can think of `?var0` as the new location where the agent wants to go, and `?var1` as the current location where the agent is starting from.\n\n**Preconditions:** The precondition for the \"move\" action is `(agent_at ?var1)`. This just means that before the agent can move, it must be verified that the agent is actually at the starting location (`?var1`). It\u2019s similar to checking if you are really at home before you walk to the park.\n\n**Effects:** After the agent moves, we need to update the agent's location in the game. This is what the effects in the action schema do:\n- `(agent_at ?var0)` says that the agent is now at the new location (`?var0`), like saying, \"Now, I\u2019m at the park.\"\n- `(not (agent_at ?var1))` means that the agent is no longer at the starting location (`?var1`), similar to saying, \"I'm no longer at home.\"\n\nThis change in the agent's location is crucial for the game to keep track of where the agent is at any moment, which affects what the agent can interact with or what actions they can perform next. The effect ensures the game world is accurately updated following the agent's movement, and no confusion arises about where the agent is located. \n\nSo, in simple terms, the action \"move\" in this game ensures that when the agent moves from one spot to another, the game correctly recognizes this change and updates the world accordingly.",
    "pick": "**Explanation:**\n\nLet's imagine you're in a simplified game environment similar to Minecraft, where your goal is to gather resources like fruits or tools. In this game, to collect an item, you'd first need to be at the same location as the item. This ensures you can actually reach it to pick it up.\n\nSo, in the PDDL (which is a planning language used to describe tasks and environments in a structured way), the `pick` action is defined to help you collect these items. Here's why the action is set up this way:\n\n1. **Preconditions (the must-haves before acting)**:\n   - `(at ?var0 ?var1)`: This means the item (`?var0`) must be at your current location (`?var1`). Think of it as seeing a piece of fruit right at your feet. You need to be where the fruit is to pick it up.\n   - `(agent_at ?var1)`: This specifies that you (the agent) must also be at that specific location (`?var1`). Just like in real life, you can't pick up something if you're not right there with it.\n\n2. **Effects (what happens after the action)**:\n   - `(inventory ?var0)`: Once you pick up the item, it moves into your inventory. This is like putting the fruit into your backpack.\n   - `(not (at ?var0 ?var1))`: This indicates that the item is no longer lying on the ground at that location. It\u2019s like saying, now that the fruit is in your backpack, it's not on the ground anymore.\n\nThis setup ensures that you can only pick up items that are within your immediate reach and that collecting an item changes its status from being 'on the ground' to being 'in your inventory'. It's a simple but effective way to manage resources in the game, making sure everything happens in a logical and realistic manner.",
    "equip": "**Explanation:**\nLet's think of the action called \"equip\" like someone getting ready to use something from their backpack. Imagine you're planning to paint a picture. First, you need to make sure you have a paintbrush in your backpack (this is similar to the \"inventory\" in our scenario). You also need to make sure your hand is free to hold the paintbrush (like the \"handsfree\" condition).\n\nIn the \"equip\" action in this Minecraft-like environment, two main things need to happen before the action can take place:\n1. **The item is in the inventory** - This is just like making sure the paintbrush is in your backpack. The precondition `(inventory ?var0)` confirms that the item you want to use is actually with you, stored safely in your inventory.\n2. **The agent's hands are free** - This means you aren't holding anything else. The precondition `(handsfree ?var1)` checks that your hands (or the agent's hands, in this case) are empty and ready to hold something new.\n\nWhen you decide to \"equip\" or start using the item, several things change:\n- **The item is now equipped** - This means the item is in your hand and ready to use, similar to how you would hold a paintbrush when you're ready to paint. This is shown by the effect `(equipped ?var0 ?var1)`.\n- **Your hand is no longer free** - Just like when you pick up the paintbrush, your hand isn't empty anymore. This is why the effect includes `(not (handsfree ?var1))`.\n- **The item is no longer just in the inventory** - Since you're now holding the item, it's not just sitting in your backpack. This change is represented by `(not (inventory ?var0))`.\n\nThese changes ensure that the action of equipping something is logical and makes sense in the environment, just like how you'd logically take a paintbrush out of your backpack to use it.",
    "craft_plank": "**Explanation:**\nLet's imagine that in the world of Minecraft, the agent (like a player) wants to craft planks from a log. Think of it like a cook needing specific ingredients and tools to make a meal.\n\nIn our PDDL model, the action named \"craft_plank\" follows a similar thought process. Here's how the description of the world leads to the rules in our model:\n\n1. **Preconditions**: Before crafting, certain conditions must be met:\n   - The agent must have a log that they are actually holding. This is represented by `(equipped ?var2 ?var1)` meaning the log (`?var2`) is equipped by the agent (`?var1`).\n   - The log must be a real log, confirmed by `(is_log ?var2)`.\n   - We also see `(hypothetical ?var0)`. Here, the planks that will be created are initially just an idea (hypothetical) before they become real.\n\n2. **Effects**: After the action is performed, we expect changes:\n   - The hypothetical planks become real, shown by `(inventory ?var0)` which means the planks (`?var0`) are now in the agent's inventory.\n   - They are identified as planks with `(is_planks ?var0)`.\n   - The agent's hands become free `(handsfree ?var1)` because the log they were holding is now transformed into planks.\n   - The log is no longer equipped or identified as a log, shown by `(not (equipped ?var2 ?var1))` and `(not (is_log ?var2))`. This indicates the log has been used up.\n\nThis schema carefully makes sure that the agent can only craft planks if they have a log to start with, and it accounts for what happens to the log and the newly created planks. It's much like ensuring you have flour before you bake a cake, and then, once the cake is baked, you no longer have just flour but a delicious cake instead!"
