    "check-out": "**Explanation:** \n\nImagine a librarian in a library who helps patrons borrow books. When a patron wants to borrow a book, the librarian needs to make sure certain conditions are met before they can check the book out. These conditions are called \"preconditions.\"\n\nFor the action \"check-out,\" let's think about what needs to be true before the librarian can let the patron borrow the book:\n\n1. **The book must be accessible:** This means the book is not covered by other books or objects, making it easy for the librarian to pick up. If the book isn't accessible, the librarian can't reach it to check it out.\n2. **The book must not be already checked out:** If the book is already checked out to someone else, it can't be borrowed by another patron until it's returned.\n\nOnce these preconditions are met, the librarian can proceed with the check-out action. The action results in several changes, called \"effects,\" that update the status of the book:\n\n1. **The book is marked as checked out:** This indicates that the book is now borrowed and can't be checked out by another patron until it's returned.\n2. **The book is no longer accessible:** Since the book is borrowed, it's no longer available on the shelf for others to take.\n3. **There is a request for the book:** This keeps track of the borrowing transaction.\n4. **A return due date is set:** This helps the library know when to expect the book back.\n\nTo summarize, the preconditions ensure the librarian can access the book and that it isn't already borrowed. The effects update the system to show the book is now checked out, not accessible, and has a return due date.",
