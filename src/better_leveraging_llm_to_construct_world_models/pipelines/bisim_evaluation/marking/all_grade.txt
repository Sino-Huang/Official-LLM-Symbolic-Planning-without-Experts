Explanation:
Solve: This term is used to assess whether the planner can find a plan based on the generated domain model.
St-Validates: This term is used to assess whether the plan generated from the domain model is valid when applied to the actual groundtruth domain setting.
Ref-Validates: This term is used to evaluate whether the reference solution (groundtruth plan) is valid when applied to the generated domain model.
Aligns: This term is used to assess the equivalence between two planning domains are “equivalent” using Bisimulation theory.
