## Things to analyze
- when the number of ensembles varies and the description granularity varies, how many total generated domain models are there? And how many of them are plan valid?
- when we use CP mechanism, how the results changes as we choose different alpha values?
  - in the report we will only pick the optimal alpha value to show the results
